abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the frequency of isoattenuating pancreatic adenocarcinoma with multi–detector row computed tomography (CT) and determine whether there are specific secondary signs that aid in detection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma underwent contrast material–enhanced biphasic multi–detector row CT with curved planar reformation. Tumors were initially deemed isoattenuating or hypoattenuating to normal pancreatic parenchyma on the basis of visual inspection, and the degree of attenuation was confirmed by calculating the mean attenuation differences between normal pancreatic parenchyma and tumor (tumor-pancreas contrast) during the pancreatic phase. Indirect signs of pancreatic tumor were tabulated in patients with an isoattenuating tumor.
RESULTS: Of the 53 patients, six (11\%) had isoattenuating tumors with a mean tumor-pancreas contrast of 9.25 HU ± 11.3 during the pancreatic phase and 4.15 HU ± 8.5 during the portal venous phase. The secondary signs of pancreatic tumor in these six patients included an interrupted pancreatic duct (n = 5), dilated biliary and pancreatic ducts (n = 1), atrophic distal pancreatic parenchyma (n = 3), and mass effect and/or convex contour abnormality (n = 3). The mean tumor-pancreas contrast for the remaining 47 patients was 74.76 HU ± 35.61 during the pancreatic phase.
CONCLUSION: With no visible tumor-pancreas contrast for isoattenuating tumors, indirect signs such as mass effect, atrophic distal parenchyma, and an interrupted duct sign are important indicators for the presence of tumor.},

abstract = {Purpose: To evaluate the enhancement patterns, prevalence of secondary signs, and histopathologic features of 20-mm-diameter or smaller pancreatic cancers seen on multiphasic multidetector computed tomographic (CT) images.Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board; the requirement for informed consent was waived. From January 2002 through September 2009, the authors reviewed the clinical and imaging data of 130 consecutive patients (76 men, 54 women; mean age, 64.1 years; age range, 28–82 years) who had surgically proven 30-mm-diameter or smaller pancreatic cancers and underwent preoperative multidetector CT and 33 consecutive patients (17 men, 16 women; mean age, 65.1 years; age range, 48–84 years) who had histopathologically proven pancreatic cancer and underwent incidental multidetector CT before the diagnosis was rendered. Only pancreatic phase CT was performed in two patients, and only hepatic venous phase CT was performed in nine patients. Two radiologists in consensus classified the tumor attenuation as hyper-, iso-, or hypoattenuation during the pancreatic and hepatic venous phases. Accompanying secondary signs, temporal changes in tumor attenuation, and histopathologic findings also were analyzed. The Fisher exact test, $\chi$2 test, generalized estimating equation, and Student t test were used to compare the variables.Results: Seventy tumors were 20 mm or smaller, and 93 were 21–30 mm. Isoattenuating pancreatic cancers were more commonly observed among the 20-mm or smaller tumors (16 of 59, 27\%) than among the 21–30-mm tumors (12 of 93, 13\%) (P = .033). They were also more common among well-differentiated tumors (seven of 12, 58\%) than among moderately differentiated (20 of 124, 16\%) and poorly differentiated (one of 10, 10\%) tumors (P = .001). The prevalence of secondary signs differed significantly according to tumor size (53 [76\%] of 70 ≤20-mm tumors vs 92 [99\%] of 93 21–30-mm tumors) (P < .001). The prevalence of secondary signs was high among isoattenuating pancreatic cancers (14 [88\%] of 16 ≤20-mm tumors vs all 12 [100\%] 21–30-mm tumors). Most of the isoattenuating tumors seen at prediagnostic CT were hypoattenuating after 6 months (100\% [four of four] during pancreatic phase, 71\% [five of seven] during hepatic venous phase).Conclusion: The prevalence of isoattenuating pancreatic cancers differed significantly according to tumor size and cellular differentiation. Most small isoattenuating pancreatic cancers showed secondary signs.© RSNA, 2011Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101133/-/DC1},

abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The risk of pancreatic cancer is increased in patients with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer or a predisposing germline mutation. Screening can detect curable, noninvasive pancreatic neoplasms, but the optimal imaging approach is not known. We determined the baseline prevalence and characteristics of pancreatic abnormalities using 3 imaging tests to screen asymptomatic, high-risk individuals (HRIs). METHODS: We screened 225 asymptomatic adult HRIs at 5 academic US medical centers once, using computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). We compared results in a blinded, independent fashion. RESULTS: Ninety-two of 216 HRIs (42\%) were found to have at least 1 pancreatic mass (84 cystic, 3 solid) or a dilated pancreatic duct (n = 5) by any of the imaging modalities. Fifty-one of the 84 HRIs with a cyst (60.7\%) had multiple lesions, typically small (mean, 0.55 cm; range, 2-39 mm), in multiple locations. The prevalence of pancreatic lesions increased with age; they were detected in 14\% of subjects younger than 50 years old, 34\% of subjects 50-59 years old, and 53\% of subjects 60-69 years old (P < .0001). CT, MRI, and EUS detected a pancreatic abnormality in 11\%, 33.3\%, and 42.6\% of the HRIs, respectively. Among these abnormalities, proven or suspected neoplasms were identified in 85 HRIs (82 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and 3 pancreatic endocrine tumors). Three of 5 HRIs who underwent pancreatic resection had high-grade dysplasia in less than 3 cm intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and in multiple intraepithelial neoplasias. CONCLUSIONS: Screening of asymptomatic HRIs frequently detects small pancreatic cysts, including curable, noninvasive high-grade neoplasms. EUS and MRI detect pancreatic lesions better than CT.},

abstract = {Morphology-based imaging modalities have replaced classical conventional nuclear medicine modalities for detection of liver or pancreatic lesions. With positron emission tomography and the glucose analog F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a sensitive and specific modality for the detection of hepatic metastases and extrahepatic tumor deposits from hepatocellular or pancreatic cancer is available. F-18 FDG PET can increase the accuracy of staging primary tumors of the liver or the pancreas, and can be used for response monitoring. Radiopharmaceuticals such as Ga-68 DOTATOC and F-18 DOPA allow the specific detection of neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors and their metastatic deposits. Hybrid scanners such as PET-CT integrate morphologic and metabolic information, and allow to increase the sensitivity and specificity of noninvasive imaging in many tumor entities. The development of specific radiopharmaceuticals and technical innovations such as SPECT-CT has increased the reliability of conventional scintigraphic imaging.

abstract = {BACKGROUND

Several factors contribute to the high mortality of pancreatic cancer, including limitations of diagnostic imaging.


AIM

To perform a meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of Fluro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography compared with computed tomography alone.


METHODS

Articles were identified through a MEDLINE search and bibliography review. Summary estimates and receiver operating curves were calculated using Meta-Test 0.6. Publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed with a funnel plot and chi-squared test.


RESULTS

The summary estimate and 95\% confidence interval for sensitivity and specificity were as follows: computed tomography 81\% (72-88\%) and 66\% (53-77\%), PET after a positive computed tomography 92\% (87-95\%) and 68\% (51-81\%), PET after a negative computed tomography 73\% (50-88\%) and 86\% (75-93\%) and PET after an indeterminate computed tomography 100 and 68\%. The area under the summary receiver operating curve was 0.82 for computed tomography and 0.94 for PET. There was no heterogeneity or publication bias.


CONCLUSIONS

Our results suggest that although adding Fluro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography to the diagnostic work-up may enhance the diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy, its usefulness will vary depending upon the pretest probability of the patient, the results of computed tomography and the provider's testing thresholds. Further evaluation using a well-designed prospective study with a cost-effectiveness analysis is needed to clarify the appropriate role of Fluro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE

The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of pancreatic perfusion computed tomography (CT) and review pancreatic perfusion measurements by various imaging modalities.


METHODS

Dynamic CT data from 8 patients (4 men; mean age, 64.8 [SD, 12.1] years; range, 40-80 years) with normal pancreas were analyzed using 2 analytical models: the maximum-slope and compartment-model methods. Literature search was also performed.


RESULTS

Although the perfusion value estimated by the maximum-slope method (88.1 [SD, 42.1] mL/min per 100 mL) was significantly smaller than that of the compartment-model method (127.0 [SD, 70.5]; P < 0.001), there was a linear correlation between them (r = 0.97, P < 0.001). In the literature review, 15 studies that reported the absolute values of normal pancreatic perfusion, by using perfusion CT, dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, hydrogen gas clearance method, and 15O-H2O-positron emission tomography were found. The reported mean values of normal pancreatic perfusion ranged from 38.4 to 356 mL/min per 100 mL, and there was a great deal of individual variation.


CONCLUSIONS

Perfusion CT may provide reliable perfusion measurements of the pancreas, and the normal value was estimated at around 100 mL/min per 100 mL with a great deal of individual variation. The maximum-slope method may provide a lower perfusion value compared with the compartment-model method.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG PET) as a tool for the differential diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma while taking into account serum glucose level. A group of 106 patients with unclear pancreatic masses were recruited for the study. PET was performed following intravenous administration of an average of 190 MBq [18F]FDG. Focally increased glucose utilisation was used as the criterion of malignancy. In addition, the "standardised uptake value" (SUV) was determined 45 min after injection. Carcinoma of the pancreas was demonstrated histologically in 74 cases, and chronic pancreatitis in 32 cases. Employing visual evaluation, 63 of the 74 (85\%) pancreatic carcinomas were identified by PET. In 27 of the 32 cases (84\%) of chronic pancreatitis it was possible to exclude malignancy. False-negative results (n=11) were obtained mostly in patients with raised serum glucose levels (10 out of 11), and false-positives (n=5) in patients with inflammatory processes of the pancreas. Thus PET showed an overall sensitivity of 85\%, a specificity of 84\%, a negative predictive value of 71\%, and a positive predictive value of 93\%. In a subgroup of patients with normal serum glucose levels (n=72), the results were 98\%, 84\%, 96\% and 93\%, respectively. Quantitative assessment yielded a mean SUV of 6.4+/-3.6 for pancreatic carcinoma as against a value of 3.6+/-1.7 for chronic pancreatitis (P<0.001), without increasing the diagnostic accuracy. This shows PET to be of value in assessing unclear pancreatic masses. The diagnostic accuracy of PET examinations is very dependent on serum glucose levels.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES We investigated the clinical and radiological features of focal mass-forming autoimmune pancreatitis (FMF AIP) to help physicians avoid performing unnecessary surgery because of an improper diagnosis. METHODS We evaluated 23 patients with chronic inflammatory pancreatic masses and who underwent pancreatectomy for presumed pancreatic cancer from April 1995 to December 2005. These patients were distinguished into 8 FMF AIP patients and 15 ordinary chronic pancreatitis patients through a histological review, along with considering the immunoglobulin G4 staining. Twenty-six randomly selected pancreatic cancer patients were also evaluated as a control group. RESULTS On the portal venous phase of computed tomography, 6 (85.7\%) of 7 FMF AIP patients showed homogeneous enhancement, whereas only 3 chronic pancreatitis patients (25\%) and none of the pancreatic cancer patients showed homogeneous enhancement (P < 0.001). None of the FMF AIP patients showed upstream main pancreatic duct dilatation greater than 5 mm or proximal pancreatic atrophy. CONCLUSIONS For patients with a pancreatic mass, if their radiological images show homogeneous enhancement on the portal venous phase, the absence of significant upstream main pancreatic duct dilatation greater than 5 mm, and the absence of proximal pancreatic atrophy, then conducting further evaluations should be considered to avoid performing unnecessary surgery.},

abstract = {The strength of functional imaging lies in its ability to detect malignant disease irrespective of lesion morphology. In this setting, 18FDG-PET can complement management by providing a more accurate diagnosis. When combined as an adjunct to CT, 18FDG-PET can increase the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for detecting a pancreatic malignancy, especially in patients in whom CT alone fails to identify a discrete mass or in whom biopsy results are indeterminate. This capability is accentuated with small lesions of the pancreas. 18FDG-PET is significantly more sensitive in detecting metastatic disease than conventional CT imaging. Moreover, 18FDG-PET is able to differentiate tumor response to therapy in the postoperative setting, and could potentially serve to monitor recurrence patterns in the setting of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Finally, as 18FDG-PET/CT fusion modalities become more widespread and technical advances in image acquisition progress, 18FDG-PET will continue to have an increasing role in the diagnosis, staging, and surveillance of pancreatic cancer, integrating anatomic information with functional imaging.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) elastography is a novel method for visualization of tissue elasticity modulus during a conventional EUS examination. The reported yield of EUS elastography for the differentiation of benign and malignant pancreatic masses has shown variable results. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of EUS elastography by pooling data of available trials.
METHODS: The Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Trials databases were used to retrieve all the studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of EUS elastography for the differentiation of benign and malignant pancreatic masses. Pooling was carried out using a fixed-effect model when significant heterogeneity was not present; otherwise, the random-effect model was used. If there were less than four studies using the same diagnostic standard, forest plots were constructed without pooling.
RESULTS: In six studies using the qualitative color pattern as the diagnostic standard, the sensitivity was 99\% (95\% confidence interval 98-100\%) and the specificity was 74\% (95\% confidence interval 65-82\%). The area under the curve under the summary receiver-operating characteristic was 0.9624. In three studies using the quantitative hue histogram value as the diagnostic standard, the sensitivity was 85-93\% and the specificity was 64-76\%.
CONCLUSION: EUS elastography is a promising noninvasive technique for the differentiation of pancreatic masses with a high sensitivity, and may prove to be a valuable complementary method to EUS-FNA.},

abstract = {Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a common gastrointestinal malignancy that has a poor prognosis and for which successful surgical resection is the only method of cure. Preoperative staging and assessment can be performed with a number of modalities. Multidetector (64-section) volumetric computed tomography (CT) allows rapid anatomic coverage coupled with excellent spatial resolution. Understanding the technical parameters necessary for successful pancreatic CT angiography is crucial. Carefully timed scan acquisition maximizes the difference in attenuation between the neoplasm and the pancreatic parenchyma and allows accurate local and distant staging as well as assessment of local resectability. In addition, angiographic data sets can be rendered to create displays of the local venous and arterial anatomy that are familiar to surgeons. Advanced rendering can also be used to create pancreaticographic type images. The TNM system of staging for pancreatic adenocarcinoma is not frequently included in radiology reporting but is important for deciding on optimal therapy and neoadjuvant therapy.© RSNA, 2007},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the regional pancreatectomy as surgical therapy for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and to evaluate potential prognostic factors. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Regional pancreatectomy was developed as a more adequate surgical procedure for pancreatic cancer in an attempt to improve the cure rate for this highly lethal disease. Few studies have evaluated large numbers of patients treated with this technique, and in recent years the emphasis has been on more limited surgery for pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Fifty-six patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head were treated by regional subtotal or total pancreatectomy. Clinical and pathologic parameters were reviewed and potential prognostic factors were compared statistically. The three patients who died within 30 days of the operation were excluded from the survival analysis. RESULTS: Primary tumor size was the strongest determinant of prognosis. The mean tumor size was 3.9 cm (range, 1-7 cm). Eighty-five percent of patients had peripancreatic soft tissue invasion microscopically, and 58\% had regional lymph node metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated a 33\% 5-year survival for patients with tumor 2.5 cm or less in diameter (n=12) and 12\% for patients with larger tumors (n=39). No patient with a tumor larger than 5 cm survived more than 5 years. Mean tumor size was not significantly associated with lymph node metastases, but 5 of 12 patients (42\%) with primary tumor < or =2.5 cm had lymph node metastases. Twenty-four percent of patients with negative lymph nodes and 14\% with positive lymph nodes survived 5 years. The difference was not statistically significant (p=0.3), but this is likely related to sample size. The 30- day operative mortality was 5.3\%. The most common complications were infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and gastric stasis. CONCLUSIONS: After regional pancreatectomy, tumor size is the strongest predictor of prognosis. A multi- institutional randomized prospective trial of regional pancreatectomy versus pancreaticoduodenectomy is warranted in previously untreated, noninfected cases.},

It was agreed that the following were candidates for screening: first-degree relatives (\{FDRs)\} of patients with \{PC\} from a familial \{PC\} kindred with at least two affected \{FDRs;\} patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome; and p16, \{BRCA2\} and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (\{HNPCC)\} mutation carriers with \{$\backslash$textgreater\}/= 1 affected \{FDR.\} Consensus was not reached for the age to initiate screening or stop surveillance. It was agreed that initial screening should include endoscopic ultrasonography (\{EUS)\} and/or \{MRI/magnetic\} resonance cholangiopancreatography not \{CT\} or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. There was no consensus on the need for \{EUS\} fine-needle aspiration to evaluate cysts. There was disagreement on optimal screening modalities and intervals for follow-up imaging. When surgery is recommended it should be performed at a high-volume centre. There was great disagreement as to which screening abnormalities were of sufficient concern to for surgery to be recommended. \{CONCLUSIONS:\} Screening is recommended for high-risk individuals, but more evidence is needed, particularly for how to manage patients with detected lesions.

@article{Miura2006,
abstract = {The ability to diagnose pancreatic carcinoma has been rapidly improving with the recent advances in diagnostic techniques such as contrast-enhanced Doppler ultrasound (US), helical computed tomography (CT), enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic US (EUS). Each technique has advantages and limitations, making the selection of the proper diagnostic technique, in terms of purpose and characteristics, especially important. Abdominal US is the modality often used first to identify a cause of abdominal pain or jaundice, while the accuracy of conventional US for diagnosing pancreatic tumors is only 50–70\%. CT is the most widely used imaging examination for the detection and staging of pancreatic carcinoma. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is generally depicted as a hypoattenuating area on contrast-enhanced CT. The reported sensitivity of helical CT in revealing pancreatic carcinoma is high, ranging between 89\% and 97\%. Multi-detector-row (MD) CT may offer an improvement in the early detection and accurate staging of pancreatic carcinoma. It should be taken into consideration that some pancreatic adenocarcinomas are depicted as isoattenuating and that pancreatitis accompanied by pancreatic adenocarcinoma might occasionally result in the overestimation of staging. T1-weighted spin-echo images with fat suppression and dynamic gradient-echo MR images enhanced with gadolinium have been reported to be superior to helical CT for detecting small lesions. However, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma are not distinguished on the basis of degree and time of enhancement on dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MRI. EUS is superior to spiral CT and MRI in the detection of small tumors, and can also localize lymph node metastases or vascular tumor infiltration with high sensitivity. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a safe and highly accurate method for tissue diagnosis of patients with suspected pancreatic carcinoma. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has been suggested as a promising modality for noninvasive differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. Previous studies reported the sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET for detecting malignant pancreatic tumors as being 71–100\% and 64–90\%, respectively. FDG-PET does not replace, but is complementary to morphologic imaging, and therefore, in doubtful cases, the method must be combined with other imaging modalities.},

abstract = {The fate of a patient with acute pancreatitis largely depends on early recognition of the severity of the disease. Acute pancreatitis is severe when organ failure and/or pancreatic necrosis occur. Whereas simple and low cost parameters are available for the detection of organ failure, the detection and extent of pancreatic necrosis requires a costly contrast-enhanced computed tomography. This is not always available in all institutions. This review article which considers when the clinician should be concerned about his patient diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, summarizes possibilities for diagnosing clinical severe (that is organ failure) and radiological severe (that is the necrotizing form of the disease) pancreatitis using simple and inexpensive parameters which are available everywhere. At present, a CT scan should be performed in those patients with alcohol etiology, those admitted to hospital early (time interval between the onset of symptoms and admission to hospital of less than 24 h, those presenting with rebound tenderness and/or guarding, a lipase >1,000 U/l, as well as a raised hematocrit and blood glucose. The evaluation, furthermore, shows that some parameters have a sufficiently high negative predictive value of >90\%, which may render a contrast-enhanced CT scan unnecessary in the early stages, unless the patient fails to improve. These parameters include non-alcohol etiology, time interval between onset and admission to hospital longer than 24 h, no guarding or rebound tenderness on admission, low or normal hematocrit and nonelevated blood glucose. It is necessary to look further on simple low cost and more valid parameters on admission in order to reliably distinguish between necrotizing pancreatitis and interstitial pancreatitis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND

It is well known that pancreatic cancer is rarely cured and is usually fatal. The clinicopathological features of small (greatest dimension < or = 2 cm by histologic measurement) carcinoma of the pancreas (s-PC), were reviewed, paying special attention to new computed tomography (CT) finding that suggests the presence of s-PC.


METHODOLOGY

Sixteen patients with s-PC have undergone curative surgery at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital during the past 11 years. Their preoperative diagnostic findings, pathological findings and postoperative prognoses were analyzed.


RESULTS

The most useful diagnostic clue was dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (MPD). It was difficult to identify the tumor in four patients because of pancreatitis accompanying the MPD obstruction. In three of these four cases, early phase-enhanced CT revealed a contrasting effect between the proximal and distal sides of the pancreatic parenchyma at the site of the MPD obstruction (black \& white sign). The longest diameters of the tumors ranged from 0.9 to 2 cm (average 1.3 cm). Positive rates of capsular invasion, retroperitoneal invasion, and lymph node metastasis were 6.3\% (1/16), 31.3\% (5/16), and 18.8\% (3/16), respectively. Six patients (37.5\%) were classed at stage I, six (37.5\%) stage II, three (18.8\%) stage III, and one (6.2\%) at stage IV according to pathological TNM classification. One patient died of the disease, and the cumulative 3- and 5-year survival rates were 88.9\% and 59.3\%, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS

The presence of s-PC qualifies as early PC and has a good prognosis. The CT black + white sign will be useful in the diagnosis of s-PC accompanying pancreatitis.},

abstract = {A wide spectrum of anomalies of the pancreas, the pancreatic ductal system, and the biliary tree are commonly encountered at radiologic evaluation. These anomalies may simulate various neoplastic, inflammatory, and posttraumatic conditions and should be part of the differential diagnosis for a variety of abnormalities found at diagnostic imaging. Anatomic variants, developmental anomalies (eg, pancreas divisum, annular pancreas, ectopic pancreas, pancreatic agenesis and hypoplasia), and congenital diseases (congenital pancreatic cysts, von Hippel–Lindau disease, choledochal cysts), in addition to potential imaging pitfalls (uneven distribution of fat, “pseudomasses”), can all pose a diagnostic challenge for the radiologist. Familiarity with these anomalies, the imaging techniques available for their study, and their variable imaging manifestations is necessary for differentiating them from other biliary and pancreatic conditions. A basic understanding of the embryologic development and normal anatomy of the pancreas and biliary tree is also essential for identifying these anomalies.© RSNA, 2006},
