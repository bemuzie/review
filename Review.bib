abstract = {Background: Coded phase inversion harmonic ultrasonography, a newly available sonographic technique, enables visualisation of slow flow in minute vessels in a real time fashion with the use of a sonographic contrast agent containing monosaccharide. Our purpose was to employ this novel technique to observe microvessels in pancreatic tumours.  Subjects and methods: Sixty five patients with suspicious pancreatic tumours received contrast enhanced coded phase inversion harmonic ultrasonography, contrast enhanced computed tomography, and endosonography. Final diagnoses based on histological findings were pancreatic ductal carcinomas in 49 patients, inflammatory pseudotumours with chronic pancreatitis in seven, and endocrine tumours in nine. For contrast enhanced coded harmonic ultrasonography, Levovist, a contrast agent, was injected intravenously as a bolus. When the first microbubble signal appeared in the pancreas, images of the ideal scanning plane were displayed in a real time continuous fashion (vessel images). Subsequently, interval delay scanning (perfusion images) was taken to demonstrate parenchymal flow. Tumour vascularity was evaluated by using the two types of imaging. Sensitivities for depicting pancreatic tumours were compared between three examinations.  Results: Contrast enhanced ultrasonography demonstrated tumour vessels in 67\% of pancreatic ductal carcinomas, although most were relatively hypovascular compared with the surrounding pancreatic tissue. The vascular patterns of tumours obtained by contrast enhanced ultrasonography were closely correlated with those obtained by contrast enhanced computed tomography. Values for sensitivity in depicting pancreatic tumours of 2 cm or less in size were 68\% for contrast enhanced computed tomography, 95\% for endosonography, and 95\% for contrast enhanced ultrasonography.  Conclusion: Contrast enhanced coded phase inversion harmonic ultrasonography successfully visualised fine vessels in pancreatic tumours and may play a pivotal role in the depiction and differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumours.},

abstract = {Fused positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is a recently developed technology that couples the functional information of PET with the anatomic details of CT. Integrated PET/CT scanners produce both PET and contrast material-enhanced CT images of the entire body in one setting. Typically, the amount of fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in normal pancreatic parenchyma is insignificant compared with that of the liver. However, both malignant (eg, adenocarcinoma) and benign (eg, acute pancreatitis) pancreatic conditions may demonstrate intense FDG uptake. PET/CT provides an opportunity to depict pancreatic tumors and distant metastases, perform preoperative staging, and monitor response to treatment, and it has proved useful in distinguishing postoperative fibrosis from recurrence. In selected cases, PET/CT findings may be used to help diagnose autoimmune pancreatitis mimicking a mass by depicting systemic involvement. PET/CT may also be used to direct biopsy to sites more likely to yield representative tumor tissue. Novel radiolabeled molecules, such as sigma-receptor ligands and 18F-3'-fluoro-3'-deoxy-l-thymidine (FLT), may play an even greater role in distinguishing tumor recurrence from postoperative fibrosis or inflammation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Differentiation between metastasis-free pancreatic cancer and mass-forming pancreatitis is important to avoid unnecessary operative procedures. This study was aimed at evaluating the efficacy of PET/CT with F-FDG (FDG PET/CT) for the differential diagnosis between them. PATIENTS AND METHODS: FDG-PET/CT was performed in 47 study patients with pancreatic masses and without any detectable metastases, 33 of which cases were finally diagnosed as pancreatic cancer and the other 14 as pancreatitis, and the corresponding imaging data were evaluated retrospectively. The maximal SUV (SUVmax) within the masses were determined at 1 hour and mostly at 2 hours after intravenous injection of FDG. RESULTS: SUVmax at 1 hour in pancreatic cancer was significantly higher than that in mass-forming pancreatitis, and the change in SUVmax from 1- to 2-hour time points was more consistent with pancreatic cancer than with mass-forming pancreatitis. However, there remained considerable overlapping between the SUVmax values of both diseases except either at the higher range for pancreatic cancer (>7.7 at 1 hour or >9.98 at 2 hours) or at the lower range for mass-forming pancreatitis (<3.37 at 1 hour or <3.53 at 2 hours). No obvious difference was found in the FDG uptake patterns of the mass areas between both diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Differentiation between metastasis-free pancreatic cancer and mass-forming pancreatitis is difficult by FDG-PET/CT due to considerable overlapping between the SUVmax values of the two diseases, although the differential diagnosis may be possible either at the higher range of SUVmax (> 7.7 at 1 hour or >9.98 at 2 hours) for pancreatic cancer or at the lower range of SUVmax (<3.37 at 1 hour or <3.53 at 2 hours) for mass-forming pancreatitis.},

The main limitation of CT is the lack of sensitivity for early pancreatic lesions.

Magnetic resonance (MR) can be helpful for evaluating small hepatic nodules or cystic lesions of the pancreas, but in general, the role of MR and positron emission tomography remains limited to special situations when the results of CT and EUS are equivocal.},

Because of the high prevalence of liver disease in patients referred for abdominal CT examinations, contrast administration and scanning techniques are usually optimized for detection of liver disease on abdominal CT scans. A wide variety of contrast techniques can be used to evaluate the liver, and it is important to understand both the rationale behind each technique and the impact on the quality of the examination when one deviates from these techniques. In addition, the timing of contrast administration and scan acquisition has become critical, and improper timing can cause lesions that are easily visualized to be obscured. This article reviews principles of lesion detection and the effects of various contrast techniques on lesion visualization.},

@article{Berberat1999b,
abstract = {The detection of pancreatic cancer or the discrimination between pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis remains an important diagnostic problem. Several imaging modalities are now used to diagnose pancreatic cancer, including transabdominal ultrasonography (US), contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasonography, and selective angiography. None of these six methods is perfect: Each has advantages and disadvantages, and their sensitivity and specificity are in a high range. In 1990 positron emission tomography (PET) was first applied to diagnose pancreatic cancer. This new diagnostic modality is based on functional changes in the pancreatic cancer cells caused by enhanced glucose metabolism. Increased glucose utilization is one of the characteristics of malignantly transformed cells, independent of their origin. The technical development of PET has allowed this new procedure to be used for clinical evaluation. Using 2-((18)F)-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose, PET can identify pancreatic cancer and differentiate pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis with a sensitivity of 85\% to 98\% and a specificity of 53\% to 93\%. However, high sensitivity and high specificity are strongly dependent on the tumor stage. At present PET is still experimental and is available only in specialized centers. It may represent a new and noninvasive diagnostic procedure for the detection and the staging of pancreatic cancer. Further clinical studies, especially including patients with early tumor stages (small tumor size), are needed. This review discusses the possibilities and limits of PET and evaluates its importance in the future.},

abstract = {The detection of pancreatic cancer or the discrimination between pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis remains an important diagnostic problem. The increased glucose metabolism in malignant tumours formed the basis for this investigation, which focused on the role of positron emission tomography (PET) with 2[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in the detection of pancreatic cancer and its differentiation from chronic pancreatitis. Eighty patients admitted for elective pancreatic surgery received preoperatively 250-350 mBq FDG intravenously and emission scans were recorded 45 minutes later. Intense focal activity in the pancreatic region was taken at the time of scanning as showing the presence of pancreatic cancer. The presence of cancer was later confirmed by histological examination of the surgical specimens and histological findings were compared with the preoperative PET results. Forty one patients with pancreatic cancer (group I: n = 42) had a focally increased FDG uptake in the pancreatic region. Two patients with a periampullary carcinoma (group II: n = 6) failed to develop FDG accumulation. In 28 patients with chronic pancreatitis (group III: n = 32) no FDG accumulation occurred. Overall sensitivity and specificity of PET for malignancy (group I + II) were 94\% (45 of 48) and 88\% (28 of 32), respectively. The standard uptake value of the patients with pancreatic carcinoma was significantly higher than in patients with chronic pancreatitis (3.09 (2.18) v 0.87 (0.56); p < 0.001; median (interquartile range)). These findings show that FDG-PET represents a new and non-invasive diagnostic procedure for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and to differentiate pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis. However, the diagnostic potential of this technique requires further evaluation.},

abstract = {Pre-operative assessment of a potentially resectable peri-pancreatic mass by computed tomography (CT) is widely used, but often of limited value for lesions less than 5 cm. ERCP is frequently used to evaluate those patients with associated obstructive jaundice. To determine the clinical effectiveness of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), patients with pancreatobiliary lesions of less than 5 cm with or without obstructive jaundice were evaluated. CT scan, ERCP, and EUS were performed on 60 patients with a peri-pancreatic mass and/or obstructive jaundice. The results of the examinations were compared with respect to detection of an abnormality, diagnosis, and prediction of resectability. ERCP and EUS were the most sensitive and specific in detecting an abnormality of the pancreatobiliary system. The accuracy of EUS compared with the accuracy of the combination of CT scan with ERCP was significantly higher for the evaluation of the specific type and extent of pancreatobiliary disease (73\% vs. 30\%, p less than 0.001) and prediction of resectability (75\% vs. 38\%, p less than 0.05). EUS aided patient management in 75\% by providing more details about the disease, and changed management in 32\% by making a diagnosis or changing an incorrect diagnosis. EUS represents a significant advance in the evaluation and clinical management of pancreatobiliary disease.},

The sensitivity and specificity of EUS for diagnosing pancreatic cancer were 89\% and 97\%, respectively. EUS had excellent sensitivity regardless of tumour size or location. EUS was accurate (90\%) in determining tumour size in pancreatic cancers less than 3 cm in maximum diameter, but not for tumours greater than 3 cm (30\%). The accuracy of tumour (T) and nodal (N) staging were 64\% and 50\%, respectively.

abstract = {Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple resection) has evolved into a safe procedure in major high-volume medical centers for the treatment of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and refractory chronic pancreatitis. However, some Whipple resections performed for a clinical suspicion of malignancy reveal only benign disease on pathologic examination. We evaluated the frequency of such Whipple resections without tumor in a large series of pancreaticoduodenectomies and classified the diverse pancreatic and biliary tract diseases present in these specimens. Of 442 Whipple resections performed during 1999-2001, 47 (10.6\%) were negative for neoplastic disease and, in 40 cases, had been performed for a clinical suspicion of malignancy. Most Whipple resections revealed benign pancreatic disease, including 8 (17\%) alcohol-associated chronic pancreatitis, 4 (8.5\%) gallstone-associated pancreatitis, 1 (2.1\%) pancreas divisum, 6 (12.8\%) "ordinary" chronic pancreatitis of unknown etiology, and 11 (23.4\%) lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis. In particular, patients with lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis were all thought to harbor malignancy, whereas only 13 of 19 (68.4\%) of Whipple resections showing histologically "ordinary" forms of chronic pancreatitis were performed for a clinical suspicion of malignancy. Benign biliary tract disease, including three cases of primary sclerosing cholangitis, two cases of choledocholithiasis-associated chronic biliary tract disease, and four fibroinflammatory strictures isolated to the intrapancreatic common bile duct, was a common etiology for clinically suspicious Whipple resections (22.5\% of cases). Pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) was a common finding among all pancreata, whether involved by pancreatitis or histologically normal. Overall, PanIN 1A/1B was present in 68.1\%, PanIN 2 in 40.4\%, and PanIN 3 in just 2.1\%. These findings indicate that "benign but clinically suspicious" Whipple resections are relatively common in high-volume centers (9.2\%) and reveal a diverse group of clinicopathologically distinctive pancreatic and biliary tract disease.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG PET) as a tool for the differential diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma while taking into account serum glucose level. A group of 106 patients with unclear pancreatic masses were recruited for the study. PET was performed following intravenous administration of an average of 190 MBq [18F]FDG. Focally increased glucose utilisation was used as the criterion of malignancy. In addition, the "standardised uptake value" (SUV) was determined 45 min after injection. Carcinoma of the pancreas was demonstrated histologically in 74 cases, and chronic pancreatitis in 32 cases. Employing visual evaluation, 63 of the 74 (85\%) pancreatic carcinomas were identified by PET. In 27 of the 32 cases (84\%) of chronic pancreatitis it was possible to exclude malignancy. False-negative results (n=11) were obtained mostly in patients with raised serum glucose levels (10 out of 11), and false-positives (n=5) in patients with inflammatory processes of the pancreas. Thus PET showed an overall sensitivity of 85\%, a specificity of 84\%, a negative predictive value of 71\%, and a positive predictive value of 93\%. In a subgroup of patients with normal serum glucose levels (n=72), the results were 98\%, 84\%, 96\% and 93\%, respectively. Quantitative assessment yielded a mean SUV of 6.4+/-3.6 for pancreatic carcinoma as against a value of 3.6+/-1.7 for chronic pancreatitis (P<0.001), without increasing the diagnostic accuracy. This shows PET to be of value in assessing unclear pancreatic masses. The diagnostic accuracy of PET examinations is very dependent on serum glucose levels.},
