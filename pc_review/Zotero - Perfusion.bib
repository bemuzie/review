abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of three analytic methods, maximum slope (MS), dual-input single-compartment model (CM) and deconvolution (DC), for CT measurements of hepatic perfusion and assess the effects of extra-hepatic systemic factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight patients who were suspected of having metastatic liver tumors underwent hepatic CT perfusion. The scans were performed at the hepatic hilum 7-77s after administration of contrast material. Hepatic arterial and portal perfusions (HAP and HPP, ml/min/100ml) and arterial perfusion fraction (APF, \%) were calculated with the three methods, followed by correlation assessment. Partial correlation analysis was used to assess the effects on hepatic perfusion values by various factors such as age, sex, risk of cardiovascular diseases, arrival time of contrast material at abdominal aorta, transit time from abdominal aorta to hepatic parenchyma, and liver dysfunction. RESULTS: Mean HAP of MS was significantly higher than DC. HPP of CM was significantly higher than MS and CM, and HPP of MS was significantly higher than DC. There was no significant difference in APF. HAP and APF showed significant and moderate correlations among the methods. HPP showed significant and moderate correlations between CM and DC, and poor correlation between MS and CM or DC. All methods showed weak correlations between HAP or APF and age or sex. Finally, MS showed weak correlations between HAP or HPP and arrival time or cardiovascular risks. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic perfusion values arrived at with the three methods are not interchangeable. CM and DC are less susceptible to extra-hepatic systemic factors.},

@article{Dugdale1999a,
abstract = {PURPOSE

Structural CT criteria such as nodal size and appearance have a poor correlation with the grade and activity of a lymphoma mass. This study investigates the potential for functional CT perfusion and permeability measurements to assess lymphoma grade and activity.


METHOD

Thirty-nine patients with proven lymphoma underwent 47 dynamic contrast-enhanced CT studies. Lymphoma grade was classified as low or intermediate/high. In seven patients who underwent repeated studies, measurements were correlated against change in disease activity in the intervening period.


RESULTS

Median perfusion values were higher in active disease (0.55 vs. 0.37 ml/min/ml) and intermediate/high-grade lymphoma (0.56 vs. 0.46 ml/min/ml). Perfusion below 0.2 ml/min/ml implied inactive disease (p < 0.03), whereas > 0.5 ml/min/ml suggested intermediate/high-grade lymphoma (p = 0.11). Median values of permeability were little different between patient groups. Only perfusion fell when disease became inactive.


CONCLUSION

Only CT perfusion measurements of nodes have potential for assessing lymphoma grade, activity, and treatment response.},

@article{Tsushima2011c,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE

The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of pancreatic perfusion computed tomography (CT) and review pancreatic perfusion measurements by various imaging modalities.


METHODS

Dynamic CT data from 8 patients (4 men; mean age, 64.8 [SD, 12.1] years; range, 40-80 years) with normal pancreas were analyzed using 2 analytical models: the maximum-slope and compartment-model methods. Literature search was also performed.


RESULTS

Although the perfusion value estimated by the maximum-slope method (88.1 [SD, 42.1] mL/min per 100 mL) was significantly smaller than that of the compartment-model method (127.0 [SD, 70.5]; P < 0.001), there was a linear correlation between them (r = 0.97, P < 0.001). In the literature review, 15 studies that reported the absolute values of normal pancreatic perfusion, by using perfusion CT, dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, hydrogen gas clearance method, and 15O-H2O-positron emission tomography were found. The reported mean values of normal pancreatic perfusion ranged from 38.4 to 356 mL/min per 100 mL, and there was a great deal of individual variation.


CONCLUSIONS

Perfusion CT may provide reliable perfusion measurements of the pancreas, and the normal value was estimated at around 100 mL/min per 100 mL with a great deal of individual variation. The maximum-slope method may provide a lower perfusion value compared with the compartment-model method.},

@article{axelRad80,
abstract = {Dynamic computed tomography (CT) using rapid-sequence scanning can be used to determine cerebral blood flow noninvasively following an intravenous bolus injection of contrast material. Since the contrast material remains intravascular in the normal brain, principles of indicator dilution analysis for nondiffusible indicators are applied to the time course of the changes in contrast concentration. While a delay is introduced by the relatively prolonged intravenous injection, this can be corrected for if the arteries are seen on the scan; the corrected mean transit time of the first passage of the bolus through the vessels gives the blood flow per unit vascular volume. To find the blood flow per unit of total tissue volume requires measuring the concentration of contrast material in the blood, which cannot always be done directly from brain scans with current CT equipment; however, a relative volume for total tissue flow can be found by using the area under the curve of contrast concentration as a function of time, as this area is proportional to the fractional vascular volume of the tissue.},
