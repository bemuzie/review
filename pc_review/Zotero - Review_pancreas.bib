abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Solid and cystic pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas is a rare tumor of the pancreas, for the first time described by Frantz et al. in 1959. The majority of patients are young females and most of them are asymptomatic.
CASE OUTLINE: We report a case of 25-year old woman who was admitted to our institution with abdominal pain and a palpable mass in the left hypochondrial area. US and CT scan revealed a solid and cystic pseudopapillary tumor in the head of the pancreas. The patient was treated by Whipple procedure, modification Longmire-Traverso. There was no metastatic disease either in the liver or peritoneum. Histologically the tumor was diagnosed as a solid and cystic pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas.
CONCLUSION: The unclear pre-operative diagnoses, together with incidence of potential malignancy as well as good outcome with resection, suggest that all suspected cystic tumors of the pancreas should be resected.The exact diagnosis is based on histological findings.},

abstract = {\{BACKGROUND:\} Screening individuals at increased risk for pancreatic cancer (\{PC)\} detects early, potentially curable, pancreatic neoplasia. \{OBJECTIVE:\} To develop consortium statements on screening, surveillance and management of high-risk individuals with an inherited predisposition to \{PC.\} \{METHODS:\} A 49-expert multidisciplinary international consortium met to discuss pancreatic screening and vote on statements. Consensus was considered reached if \{$\backslash$textgreater\}/= 75\% agreed or disagreed. \{RESULTS:\} There was excellent agreement that, to be successful, a screening programme should detect and treat \{T1N0M0\} margin-negative \{PC\} and high-grade dysplastic precursor lesions (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm). It was agreed that the following were candidates for screening: first-degree relatives (\{FDRs)\} of patients with \{PC\} from a familial \{PC\} kindred with at least two affected \{FDRs;\} patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome; and p16, \{BRCA2\} and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (\{HNPCC)\} mutation carriers with \{$\backslash$textgreater\}/= 1 affected \{FDR.\} Consensus was not reached for the age to initiate screening or stop surveillance. It was agreed that initial screening should include endoscopic ultrasonography (\{EUS)\} and/or \{MRI/magnetic\} resonance cholangiopancreatography not \{CT\} or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. There was no consensus on the need for \{EUS\} fine-needle aspiration to evaluate cysts. There was disagreement on optimal screening modalities and intervals for follow-up imaging. When surgery is recommended it should be performed at a high-volume centre. There was great disagreement as to which screening abnormalities were of sufficient concern to for surgery to be recommended. \{CONCLUSIONS:\} Screening is recommended for high-risk individuals, but more evidence is needed, particularly for how to manage patients with detected lesions. Screening and subsequent management should take place at high-volume centres with multidisciplinary teams, preferably within research protocols.},
