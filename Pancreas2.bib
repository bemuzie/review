	abstract = {The fate of a patient with acute pancreatitis largely depends on early recognition of the severity of the disease. Acute pancreatitis is severe when organ failure and/or pancreatic necrosis occur. Whereas simple and low cost parameters are available for the detection of organ failure, the detection and extent of pancreatic necrosis requires a costly contrast-enhanced computed tomography. This is not always available in all institutions. This review article which considers when the clinician should be concerned about his patient diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, summarizes possibilities for diagnosing clinical severe (that is organ failure) and radiological severe (that is the necrotizing form of the disease) pancreatitis using simple and inexpensive parameters which are available everywhere. At present, a {CT} scan should be performed in those patients with alcohol etiology, those admitted to hospital early (time interval between the onset of symptoms and admission to hospital of less than 24 h, those presenting with rebound tenderness and/or guarding, a lipase {\textgreater}1,000 U/l, as well as a raised hematocrit and blood glucose. The evaluation, furthermore, shows that some parameters have a sufficiently high negative predictive value of {\textgreater}90\%, which may render a contrast-enhanced {CT} scan unnecessary in the early stages, unless the patient fails to improve. These parameters include non-alcohol etiology, time interval between onset and admission to hospital longer than 24 h, no guarding or rebound tenderness on admission, low or normal hematocrit and nonelevated blood glucose. It is necessary to look further on simple low cost and more valid parameters on admission in order to reliably distinguish between necrotizing pancreatitis and interstitial pancreatitis.},

The lag period between diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer is usually one or two decades: pancreatitis appearing a year or two before the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is often the result of tumour-related ductal obstruction. The risk of developing pancreatic cancer appears to be highest in rare types of pancreatitis with an early onset, such as hereditary pancreatitis and tropical pancreatitis. Even though there is a strong link between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, over a 20 year period only around five percent of patients with chronic pancreatitis will develop pancreatic cancer.

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}

Survival after surgery of pancreatic cancer is still poor, even after curative resection. Some prognostic factors like the status of the resection margin, lymph node ({LN)} status, or tumor grading have been identified. However, only few data have been published regarding the prognostic influence of the {LN} ratio (number of {LN} involved to number of examined {LN).} We, therefore, evaluated potential prognostic factors in 182 patients after resection of pancreatic cancer including assessment of {LN} ratio.


{METHODS}

Since 1994, 204 patients underwent pancreatic resection for ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Survival was evaluated in 182 patients with complete follow-up evaluations. Of those 182 patients, 88\% had cancer of the pancreatic head, 5\% of the body, and 7\% of the pancreatic tail. Patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (85\%), distal resection (12\%), or total pancreatectomy (3\%). Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier and Cox methods.


{RESULTS}

In all 204 resected patients, operative mortality was 3.9\% (n = 8). In the 182 patients with follow-up, 70\% had free resection margins, 62\% had G1- or G2-classified tumors, and 70\% positive {LN.} Median tumor size was 30 (7-80) mm. The median number of examined {LN} was 16 and median number of involved {LN} 1 (range 0-22). Median {LN} ratio was 0.1 (0-0.79). Cumulative 5-year survival (5-year {SV)} in all patients was 15\%. In univariate analysis, a {LN} ratio {\textgreater} or = 0.2 (5-year {SV} 6\% vs. 19\% with {LN} ratio {\textless} 0.2; p = 0.003), {LN} ratio {\textgreater} or = 0.3 (5-year {SV} 0\% vs. 18\% with {LN} ratio {\textless} 0.3; p {\textless} 0.001), a positive resection margin (p {\textless} 0.01) and poor differentiation ({G3/G4;} p {\textless} 0.03) were associated with poorer survival. In multivariate analysis, a {LN} ratio {\textgreater} or = 0.2 (p {\textless} 0.02; relative risk {RR} 1.6), {LN} ratio {\textgreater} or = 0.3 (p {\textless} 0.001; {RR} 2.2), positive margins (p {\textless} 0.02; {RR} 1.7), and poor differentiation (p {\textless} 0.03; {RR} 1.5) were independent factors predicting a poorer outcome. The conventional nodal status or the number of examined nodes (in all patients and in the subgroups of node positive or negative patients) had no significant influence on survival. Patients with one metastatic {LN} had the same outcome as patients with negative nodes, but prognosis decreased significantly in patients with two or more {LN} involved.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Not the lymph node involvement per se but especially the {LN} ratio is an independent prognostic factor after resection of pancreatic cancers. In our series, the {LN} ratio was even the strongest predictor of survival. The routine estimation of the {LN} ratio may be helpful not only for the individual prediction of prognosis but also for the indication of adjuvant therapy and herein related outcome and therapy studies.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} To define the duct-penetrating sign at magnetic resonance ({MR)} cholangiopancreatography ({MRCP)} and to assess the usefulness of this sign for distinguishing an inflammatory pancreatic mass ({IPM)} from a conventional pancreatic carcinoma ({CPC)} compared with arterial phase computed tomography (hereafter, {CT)} and arterial phase {MR} imaging (hereafter, {MR} imaging).
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} {MRCP}, {CT}, and {MR} images were compared by means of receiver operating characteristic ({ROC)} analysis for 11 {IPMs} and 43 {CPCs.} With the {MRCP} images, a morphologic classification of the main pancreatic duct ({MPD)} was attempted for all lesions. On the basis of this classification and the enhancement patterns of a lesion, all readers graded the presence of {IPM} or {CPC} on a five-point scale for all images.
{RESULTS:} On the {MRCP} images, the morphologic characteristics of the {MPD} were nonobstruction for {IPM} (28 of 33, 85\%) and obstruction or irregular stenosis for {CPC} (124 of 129, 96\%). At {ROC} analysis among all the techniques, {MRCP} images had the highest value (0.98) for significant areas under the {ROC} curve ({CT}, 0.84; {MR}, 0.76) (P {\textless} .001). For the duct-penetrating sign in the broad sense (nonobstructed {MPD)} and the sign in the narrow sense (only normal {MPD)}, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for diagnosis of {IPM} were 85\%, 96\%, and 94\%, respectively, and 36\%, 100\%, and 87\%, respectively.
{CONCLUSION:} The duct-penetrating sign on {MRCP} images was more helpful to distinguish {IPM} from {CPC} than were the enhancement patterns on {CT} and {MR} images.},

These anomalies may simulate various neoplastic, inflammatory, and posttraumatic conditions and should be part of the differential diagnosis for a variety of abnormalities found at diagnostic imaging. Anatomic variants, developmental anomalies (eg, pancreas divisum, annular pancreas, ectopic pancreas, pancreatic agenesis and hypoplasia), and congenital diseases (congenital pancreatic cysts, von {HippelвЂ“Lindau} disease, choledochal cysts), in addition to potential imaging pitfalls (uneven distribution of fat, вЂњpseudomassesвЂќ), can all pose a diagnostic challenge for the radiologist. Familiarity with these anomalies, the imaging techniques available for their study, and their variable imaging manifestations is necessary for differentiating them from other biliary and pancreatic conditions. A basic understanding of the embryologic development and normal anatomy of the pancreas and biliary tree is also essential for identifying these anomalies.В© {RSNA}, 2006},

According to a multivariate analysis, lymph node metastasis, intrapancreatic perineural invasion, and portal vein invasion were significant prognostic factors. Subsequently, a subgroup analysis concerning nodal metastasis and intrapancreatic perineural invasion was performed in 126 patients with records of these histological findings. In the group of patients without nodal metastasis, the 5-year survival rate for those without perineural invasion was 75\%, whereas that for those with perineural invasion was 29\%, the difference in survival of these subgroups being significant (P {\textless} 0.02). In the group of patients with nodal metastasis, the 5-year survival rate for those without perineural invasion was 17\%, while that for those with perineural invasion was 10\%.

Thus, pancreatic adenocarcinoma categorized by the combination of these independent types of biological behavior showed 5-year survival rates ranging from very high to low, indicating that these two factors play an important role in the prognosis of this disease.},

Computed tomography ({CT)} is the most widely available and best-validated modality for imaging patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. To maximize the diagnostic efficacy of {CT}, use of a pancreas protocol is mandatory. The sensitivity of {CT} for diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (89\%-97\%) and its positive predictive value for predicting unresectability (89\%-100\%) are high. The positive predictive value of {CT} for predicting resectability (45\%-79\%) is low because the diagnostic criteria for diagnosing vascular invasion by tumor favors specificity over sensitivity to avoid denying surgery to patients with potentially resectable tumor. Furthermore, the sensitivity of {CT} for small hepatic and peritoneal metastases is limited. Magnetic resonance imaging has not been shown to perform better than {CT} for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but can be helpful as an adjunct to {CT}, particularly for evaluation of small hepatic lesions that cannot be fully characterized by {CT.} Ultrasound is often the first study obtained in patients with obstructive jaundice or unexplained abdominal pain, but its utility for diagnosis and staging of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma is limited. Positron emission {tomography/CT} combines the functional information provided by positron emission tomography with the anatomic information provided by {CT} and is a promising modality for imaging of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but its utility has not been established.

Abdominal {US} is the modality often used first to identify a cause of abdominal pain or jaundice, while the accuracy of conventional {US} for diagnosing pancreatic tumors is only 50вЂ“70\%. {CT} is the most widely used imaging examination for the detection and staging of pancreatic carcinoma. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is generally depicted as a hypoattenuating area on contrast-enhanced {CT.} The reported sensitivity of helical {CT} in revealing pancreatic carcinoma is high, ranging between 89\% and 97\%. Multi-detector-row ({MD)} {CT} may offer an improvement in the early detection and accurate staging of pancreatic carcinoma. It should be taken into consideration that some pancreatic adenocarcinomas are depicted as isoattenuating and that pancreatitis accompanied by pancreatic adenocarcinoma might occasionally result in the overestimation of staging. T1-weighted spin-echo images with fat suppression and dynamic gradient-echo {MR} images enhanced with gadolinium have been reported to be superior to helical {CT} for detecting small lesions. However, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma are not distinguished on the basis of degree and time of enhancement on dynamic gadolinium-enhanced {MRI.} {EUS} is superior to spiral {CT} and {MRI} in the detection of small tumors, and can also localize lymph node metastases or vascular tumor infiltration with high sensitivity. {EUS-guided} fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a safe and highly accurate method for tissue diagnosis of patients with suspected pancreatic carcinoma. {18F-fluorodeoxyglucose} ({FDG)} positron emission tomography ({PET)} has been suggested as a promising modality for noninvasive differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. Previous studies reported the sensitivity and specificity of {FDG-PET} for detecting malignant pancreatic tumors as being 71вЂ“100\% and 64вЂ“90\%, respectively. {FDG-PET} does not replace, but is complementary to morphologic imaging, and therefore, in doubtful cases, the method must be combined with other imaging modalities.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

It is well known that pancreatic cancer is rarely cured and is usually fatal. The clinicopathological features of small (greatest dimension {\textless} or = 2 cm by histologic measurement) carcinoma of the pancreas (s-{PC)}, were reviewed, paying special attention to new computed tomography ({CT)} finding that suggests the presence of s-{PC.}


{METHODOLOGY}

Sixteen patients with s-{PC} have undergone curative surgery at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital during the past 11 years. Their preoperative diagnostic findings, pathological findings and postoperative prognoses were analyzed.


{RESULTS}

The most useful diagnostic clue was dilatation of the main pancreatic duct ({MPD).} It was difficult to identify the tumor in four patients because of pancreatitis accompanying the {MPD} obstruction. In three of these four cases, early phase-enhanced {CT} revealed a contrasting effect between the proximal and distal sides of the pancreatic parenchyma at the site of the {MPD} obstruction (black \& white sign). The longest diameters of the tumors ranged from 0.9 to 2 cm (average 1.3 cm). Positive rates of capsular invasion, retroperitoneal invasion, and lymph node metastasis were 6.3\% (1/16), 31.3\% (5/16), and 18.8\% (3/16), respectively. Six patients (37.5\%) were classed at stage I, six (37.5\%) stage {II}, three (18.8\%) stage {III}, and one (6.2\%) at stage {IV} according to pathological {TNM} classification. One patient died of the disease, and the cumulative 3- and 5-year survival rates were 88.9\% and 59.3\%, respectively.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The presence of s-{PC} qualifies as early {PC} and has a good prognosis. The {CT} black + white sign will be useful in the diagnosis of s-{PC} accompanying pancreatitis.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}

It is important to recognize arterial variants in the preoperative planning of extended pancreatic resections. The absence of surgical confirmation of radiological data is a limitation of the majority of angiographic or {CT-angiographic} studies of celiac and mesenteric arterial anatomy.


{OBJECTIVE}

The purpose of this study was to test the accuracy of {CT} angiography in delineating the arterial architecture by comparing the resultant {3D} images with findings at surgery and determining the frequency of different celiac and mesenteric arterial anatomy variants.


{METHODS}

Abdominal {CT} angiographies of 350 patients were performed on a 64- and 256-{MDCT} scanner prior to major pancreatic or hepatobiliary surgery. Variants of celiac and mesenteric arterial anatomy were documented as {3D} reconstructions. Radiological data were compared to operative photographs during extended pancreaticoduodenectomies and extended distal pancreatectomies in 59 cases.


{RESULTS}

Only 197 patients (56.3\%) had the classic arterial anatomy identified at {CT} angiography. The most common variants were a replaced or accessory right hepatic artery originating from the superior mesenteric artery (62 cases, 17.7\%) and a replaced or accessory left hepatic artery (43 cases, 12.3\%) originating from the left gastric artery. According to a comparison with operative photographs, {CT} angiography demonstrated 100\% accuracy in identifying celiac and mesenteric arterial anatomy variants, stenoses, obstructions and aneurysms of the celiac and mesenteric branches, including those which were hemodynamically significant and which influence the choice and sequence of operative procedures.


{CONCLUSION}

The celiac and mesenteric arterial anatomy variants are fairly common and are of great significance in planning extended pancreatic resections. Radiological findings were fully corroborated by operative data, which means that {CT} angiography is a reliable tool for identifying celiac and mesenteric arterial anatomy aberrations and arterial lesions.},

Tumors were initially deemed isoattenuating or hypoattenuating to normal pancreatic parenchyma on the basis of visual inspection, and the degree of attenuation was confirmed by calculating the mean attenuation differences between normal pancreatic parenchyma and tumor (tumor-pancreas contrast) during the pancreatic phase. Indirect signs of pancreatic tumor were tabulated in patients with an isoattenuating tumor.
{RESULTS:} Of the 53 patients, six (11\%) had isoattenuating tumors with a mean tumor-pancreas contrast of 9.25 {HU} В± 11.3 during the pancreatic phase and 4.15 {HU} В± 8.5 during the portal venous phase. The secondary signs of pancreatic tumor in these six patients included an interrupted pancreatic duct (n = 5), dilated biliary and pancreatic ducts (n = 1), atrophic distal pancreatic parenchyma (n = 3), and mass effect and/or convex contour abnormality (n = 3). The mean tumor-pancreas contrast for the remaining 47 patients was 74.76 {HU} В± 35.61 during the pancreatic phase.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The results of case-control studies and anecdotal reports suggest that pancreatitis may be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, but there have been no studies of sufficient size and power to assess the magnitude of the relation between these two diseases.


{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}

We undertook a multicenter historical cohort study of 2015 subjects with chronic pancreatitis who were recruited from clinical centers in six countries. A total of 56 cancers were identified among these patients during a mean (+/-{SD)} follow-up of 7.4 +/- 6.2 years. The expected number of cases of cancer calculated from country-specific incidence data and adjusted for age and sex was 2.13, yielding a standardized incidence ratio (the ratio of observed to expected cases) of 26.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 19.9 to 34.2). For subjects with a minimum of two or five years of follow-up, the respective standardized incidence ratios were 16.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 11.1 to 23.7) and 14.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 8.5 to 22.8). The cumulative risk of pancreatic cancer in subjects who were followed for at least 2 years increased steadily, and 10 and 20 years after the diagnosis of pancreatitis, it was 1.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 2.6 percent) and 4.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2.0 to 5.9 percent), respectively.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The risk of pancreatic cancer is significantly elevated in subjects with chronic pancreatitis and appears to be independent of sex, country, and type of pancreatitis.},

Preoperative staging and assessment can be performed with a number of modalities. Multidetector (64-section) volumetric computed tomography ({CT)} allows rapid anatomic coverage coupled with excellent spatial resolution. Understanding the technical parameters necessary for successful pancreatic {CT} angiography is crucial. Carefully timed scan acquisition maximizes the difference in attenuation between the neoplasm and the pancreatic parenchyma and allows accurate local and distant staging as well as assessment of local resectability. In addition, angiographic data sets can be rendered to create displays of the local venous and arterial anatomy that are familiar to surgeons. Advanced rendering can also be used to create pancreaticographic type images. The {TNM} system of staging for pancreatic adenocarcinoma is not frequently included in radiology reporting but is important for deciding on optimal therapy and neoadjuvant therapy.В© {RSNA}, 2007},

	abstract = {{AIM}

To evaluate the ability of the time-signal intensity curve ({TIC)} of the pancreas obtained from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} for differentiation of focal pancreatic masses, especially pancreatic carcinoma coexisting with chronic pancreatitis and tumor-forming pancreatitis.


{METHODS}

Forty-eight consecutive patients who underwent surgery for a focal pancreatic mass, including pancreatic ductal carcinoma (n=33), tumor-forming pancreatitis (n=8), and islet cell tumor (n=7), were reviewed. Five pancreatic carcinomas coexisted with longstanding chronic pancreatitis. The pancreatic {TICs} were obtained from the pancreatic mass and the pancreatic parenchyma both proximal and distal to the mass lesion in each patient, prior to surgery, and were classified into 4 types according to the time to a peak: 25 s and 1, 2, and 3 min after the bolus injection of contrast material, namely, type-I, {II}, {III}, and {IV}, respectively, and were then compared to the corresponding histological pancreatic conditions.


{RESULTS}

Pancreatic carcinomas demonstrated type-{III} (n=13) or {IV} (n=20) {TIC.} Tumor-forming pancreatitis showed type-{II} (n=5) or {III} (n=3) {TIC.} All islet cell tumors revealed type-I. The type-{IV} {TIC} was only recognized in pancreatic carcinoma, and the {TIC} of carcinoma always depicted the slowest rise to a peak among the 3 pancreatic {TICs} measured in each patient, even in patients with chronic pancreatitis.


{CONCLUSION}

Pancreatic {TIC} from dynamic {MRI} provides reliable information for distinguishing pancreatic carcinoma from other pancreatic masses, and may enable us to avoid unnecessary pancreatic surgery and delays in making a correct diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma, especially, in patients with longstanding chronic pancreatitis.},

A variety of imaging modalities are available for assessing these solid lesions, including ultrasonography ({US)}, computed tomography ({CT)}, magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic {US}, and hybrid nuclear imaging techniques such as single photon emission computed {tomographyвЂ“CT} and positron emission {tomographyвЂ“CT}, each of which has its own strengths and limitations.

From January 2002 through September 2009, the authors reviewed the clinical and imaging data of 130 consecutive patients (76 men, 54 women; mean age, 64.1 years; age range, 28вЂ“82 years) who had surgically proven 30-mm-diameter or smaller pancreatic cancers and underwent preoperative multidetector {CT} and 33 consecutive patients (17 men, 16 women; mean age, 65.1 years; age range, 48вЂ“84 years) who had histopathologically proven pancreatic cancer and underwent incidental multidetector {CT} before the diagnosis was rendered. Only pancreatic phase {CT} was performed in two patients, and only hepatic venous phase {CT} was performed in nine patients. Two radiologists in consensus classified the tumor attenuation as hyper-, iso-, or hypoattenuation during the pancreatic and hepatic venous phases. Accompanying secondary signs, temporal changes in tumor attenuation, and histopathologic findings also were analyzed. The Fisher exact test, П‡2 test, generalized estimating equation, and Student t test were used to compare the {variables.Results:} Seventy tumors were 20 mm or smaller, and 93 were 21вЂ“30 mm. Isoattenuating pancreatic cancers were more commonly observed among the 20-mm or smaller tumors (16 of 59, 27\%) than among the 21вЂ“30-mm tumors (12 of 93, 13\%) (P = .033). They were also more common among well-differentiated tumors (seven of 12, 58\%) than among moderately differentiated (20 of 124, 16\%) and poorly differentiated (one of 10, 10\%) tumors (P = .001). The prevalence of secondary signs differed significantly according to tumor size (53 [76\%] of 70 в‰¤20-mm tumors vs 92 [99\%] of 93 21вЂ“30-mm tumors) (P {\textless} .001). The prevalence of secondary signs was high among isoattenuating pancreatic cancers (14 [88\%] of 16 в‰¤20-mm tumors vs all 12 [100\%] 21вЂ“30-mm tumors). Most of the isoattenuating tumors seen at prediagnostic {CT} were hypoattenuating after 6 months (100\% [four of four] during pancreatic phase, 71\% [five of seven] during hepatic venous {phase).Conclusion:} The prevalence of isoattenuating pancreatic cancers differed significantly according to tumor size and cellular differentiation. Most small isoattenuating pancreatic cancers showed secondary signs.В© {RSNA}, {2011Supplemental} material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101133/-{/DC1}},

This study evaluates images of early pancreatic cancer on multidetector {CT} ({MDCT)} using contrast-enhanced multiphasic imaging, and post-processed pancreatic duct images. {CT} findings and pathological features were analysed in eight patients with early pancreatic cancer. Pathological evaluation included location, size and histological grading of the tumour. {MDCT} evaluation covered the maximum diameter of the main pancreatic duct ({MPD)}, stenosis or obstruction of the {MPD}, loss of normal lobar texture and associated pancreatitis. Attenuation differences between normal pancreatic parenchyma and the tumour ({AD-PT)} were also measured. Focal stenosis or obstruction of the {MPD} with dilatation of the distal {MPD} was demonstrated in all patients. Associated pancreatitis occurred in six patients with tumours measuring 12 mm or greater. Loss of normal lobar texture was recognised in four cases with the tumour measuring 14 mm or greater. Statistically, low-attenuated lesions and high-attenuated lesions differed with respect to the tumour size (p{\textless}0.01), and a positive relationship was demonstrated between the tumour size and {AD-PT} (r = 0.84). In seven cases, {AD-PT} is higher during the arterial phase than the pancreatic phase. Early pancreatic cancer appears as low attenuation on early phase, and as high- to iso-attenuation during the pancreatic and delayed phases in respect to the tumour size. Focal stenosis or obstruction of the {MPD} with dilatation of the distal {MPD} observed on curved reformation imaging seems important in the diagnosis of early pancreatic cancer.},

Few studies have evaluated large numbers of patients treated with this technique, and in recent years the emphasis has been on more limited surgery for pancreatic cancer. {METHODS:} Fifty-six patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head were treated by regional subtotal or total pancreatectomy. Clinical and pathologic parameters were reviewed and potential prognostic factors were compared statistically. The three patients who died within 30 days of the operation were excluded from the survival analysis. {RESULTS:} Primary tumor size was the strongest determinant of prognosis. The mean tumor size was 3.9 cm (range, 1-7 cm). Eighty-five percent of patients had peripancreatic soft tissue invasion microscopically, and 58\% had regional lymph node metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated a 33\% 5-year survival for patients with tumor 2.5 cm or less in diameter (n=12) and 12\% for patients with larger tumors (n=39). No patient with a tumor larger than 5 cm survived more than 5 years. Mean tumor size was not significantly associated with lymph node metastases, but 5 of 12 patients (42\%) with primary tumor {\textless} or =2.5 cm had lymph node metastases. Twenty-four percent of patients with negative lymph nodes and 14\% with positive lymph nodes survived 5 years. The difference was not statistically significant (p=0.3), but this is likely related to sample size. The 30- day operative mortality was 5.3\%. The most common complications were infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and gastric stasis. {CONCLUSIONS:} After regional pancreatectomy, tumor size is the strongest predictor of prognosis. A multi- institutional randomized prospective trial of regional pancreatectomy versus pancreaticoduodenectomy is warranted in previously untreated, noninfected cases.},

Subtypes of collateral pathways via the dorsal pancreatic artery include a longitudinal pathway between the celiac branches and the {SMA} or its branches and a transverse pathway to either the splenic or gastroduodenal artery. A communicating channel between the right hepatic artery and the {SMA} can be a route for collateral circulation. Hepatic artery variants cause the development of unique collateral pathways that have different characteristics depending on the type of variant. These collateral pathways include intrahepatic interlobar collateral vessels, right gastric to left gastric arterial anastomoses, left hepatic to left gastric arterial anastomoses, and peribiliary arterial plexuses. Major collateral pathways in patients with celiac axis stenosis can be identified with spiral {CT}, and knowledge concerning this collateral circulation may be important for certain medical procedures such as interventional procedures for the management of hepatic tumors, pancreaticobiliary surgery, and liver transplantation.В© {RSNA}, 2002},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}

The angiographic appearance of acute necrotizing pancreatitis ({ANP)} demonstrates ischemic change with vasospasm in and around the pancreas. We investigated the role of vasospasm in pancreatic ischemia and necrosis in the early phase of human {ANP.}


{METHODS}

The relationship between the angiographic abnormalities and the perfusion status of the pancreas documented by contrast-enhanced computed tomography ({CE-CT)} was examined in 102 patients with {ANP} who were admitted during the early phase of the disease.


{RESULTS}

Ischemic change with vasospasm on angiography of the intrapancreatic and extrapancreatic arteries was observed and corresponded with the poorly perfused area of the pancreas detected by {CE-CT} done at admission. Resultant pancreatic necrosis was confirmed on follow-up {CE-CT} examination consistent with the location where angiography demonstrated ischemic change with vasospasm. Severe ischemic change on angiography was primarily observed in patients in whom more than 50\% of the pancreas was poorly perfused. The extent of the ischemic change was correlated with the extent of the poorly perfused area of the pancreas and the mortality rate.


{CONCLUSION}

These results suggest that vasospasm is involved in the development of pancreatic ischemia and necrosis in the early phase of {ANP.}},

Two radiologists blinded to the pathologic assessment of malignancy or parenchymal invasion of {IPMN} retrospectively evaluated {CT} images of 61 consecutive surgically resected tumors (26 adenomas, 15 noninvasive carcinomas, and 20 invasive carcinomas) in patients who underwent multiphase contrast materialвЂ“enhanced {CT} with 0.5- or 1-mm collimation. The findings were statistically analyzed by using univariate and multivariate analyses, with the optimal cutoff levels of each continuous parameter determined by generating receiver operating characteristic {curves.Results:} The following findings showed significant differences among the three groups: maximum diameter of the main pancreatic duct ({MPD)}, size (length of major axis) of the largest mural nodule in the {MPD} or in any associated cystic lesion, abnormal attenuating area in the surrounding parenchyma, calcification in the lesion, protrusion of the {MPD} into the ampulla of Vater, and bile duct dilatation. An {MPD} diameter of 6 mm or larger, a mural nodule of 3 mm or larger, and an abnormal attenuating area were independently predictive of malignancy. A mural nodule of 6.3 mm or larger in the {MPD} and an abnormal attenuating area were independently predictive of parenchymal invasion. According to these criteria, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for identifying malignancy were 83\%, 81\%, and 82\% and for identifying parenchymal invasion were 90\%, 88\%, and 89\%, {respectively.Conclusion:} Multisection {CT} is useful for distinguishing among adenoma, noninvasive carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma in patients with {IPMN.В©} {RSNA}, 2008},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE.} The purpose of this study was to compare mangafodipir trisodiumвЂ”enhanced {MR} imaging performed with a phased array coil and contrast-enhanced single-detector helical {CT} for accuracy in the detection and local staging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and in the differentiation between cancer and focal pancreatitis.
{SUBJECTS} {AND} {METHODS.} Forty-two patients with suspected pancreatic masses underwent contrast-enhanced helical {CT} and mangafodipir trisodiumвЂ”enhanced {MR} imaging at 1.5 T. The images were assessed for the presence or absence of tumors; characterization of masses; and presence of vascular invasion, lymph node metastases, or liver metastases. Imaging findings were correlated with findings at laparotomy, laparoscopy, biopsy, or follow-up.
{RESULTS.} Focal masses were present in 36 patients (cancer, n = 26; focal pancreatitis, n = 7; other, n = 3). The sensitivity for lesion detection of {MR} imaging was 100\% and of {CT}, 94\%. Two small malignant lesions were missed on {CT.} For the diagnosis of tumor nonresectability, the sensitivity of {MR} imaging and {CT} was 90\% and 80\%, respectively. Liver metastases were missed on {MR} imaging in one of the eight patients and on {CT} in four. For differentiation between adenocarcinoma and nonadenocarcinoma, the sensitivity of {MR} imaging was 100\% (positive predictive value, 90\%; negative predictive value, 100\%), and the sensitivity of {CT} was 92\% (positive predictive value, 80\%; negative predictive value, 67\%). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the mean area under the curve for {MR} imaging was 0.920 and for {CT}, 0.832 (not significant).
{CONCLUSION.} Mangafodipir trisodiumвЂ”enhanced {MR} imaging is as accurate as contrast-enhanced helical {CT} for the detection and staging of pancreatic cancer but offers improved detection of small pancreatic metastases and of liver metastases compared with {CT.}},

	volume = {229},
	issn = {0003-4932},
	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1420818/},
	abstract = {Objective
To assess the accuracy and clinical impact of 18fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography ({18FDG-PET)} on the management of patients with suspected primary or recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and to assess the utility of {18FDG-PET} in grading tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation.

Summary Background Data
The diagnosis, staging, and treatment of pancreatic cancer remain difficult. Small primary tumors and hepatic metastases are often not well visualized by computed tomographic scanning ({CT)}, resulting in a high incidence of nontherapeutic celiotomy and the frequent need for вЂњblind resection.вЂќ In addition, the distinction between local recurrence and nonspecific postoperative changes after resection can be difficult to ascertain on standard anatomic imaging. {18FDG-PET} is a new imaging technique that takes advantage of increased glucose metabolism by tumor cells and may improve the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative studies for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Methods
Eighty-one {18FDG-PET} scans were obtained in 70 patients undergoing evaluation for suspected primary or recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Of this group, 65 underwent evaluation for suspected primary pancreatic cancer. Nine patients underwent {18FDG-PET} imaging before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiation, and in eight patients {18FDG-PET} scans were performed for possible recurrent adenocarcinoma after resection. The {18FDG-PET} images were analyzed visually and semiquantitatively using the standard uptake ratio ({SUR).} The sensitivity and specificity of {18FDG-PET} and {CT} were determined for evaluation of the preoperative diagnosis of primary pancreatic carcinoma, and the impact of {18FDG-PET} on patient management was retrospectively assessed.

Results
Among the 65 patients evaluated for primary tumor, 52 had proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 13 had benign lesions. {18FDG-PET} had a higher sensitivity and specificity than {CT} in correctly diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma (92\% and 85\% vs. 65\% and 62\%). Eighteen patients (28\%) had indeterminate or unrecognized pancreatic masses on {CT} clarified with {18FDG-PET.} Seven patients (11\%) had indeterminate or unrecognized metastatic disease clarified with {18FDG-PET.} Overall, {18FDG-PET} suggested potential alterations in clinical management in 28/65 patients (43\%) with suspected primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Of the nine patients undergoing {18FDG-PET} imaging before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiation, four had evidence of tumor regression by {PET}, three showed stable disease, and two showed tumor progression. {CT} was unable to detect any response to neoadjuvant therapy in this group. Eight patients had {18FDG-PET} scans to evaluate suspected recurrent disease after resection. Four were noted to have new regions of {18FDG-uptake} in the resection bed; four had evidence of new hepatic metastases. All proved to have metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Conclusions
These data confirm that {18FDG-PET} is useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected primary or recurrent pancreatic carcinoma. {18FDG-PET} is more sensitive and specific than {CT} in the detection of small primary tumors and in the clarification of hepatic and distant metastases. {18FDG-PET} was also of benefit in assessing response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Although {18FDG-PET} cannot replace {CT} in defining local tumor resectability, the application of {18FDG-PET} in addition to {CT} may alter clinical management in a significant fraction of patients with suspected pancreatic cancer.},

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of elevated plasma glucose levels on tumor detection.


{METHODS}

One-hundred and seventy-one fasted patients (100 malignant pancreatic tumors, 46 chronic pancreatitis and 25 patients with other benign pancreatic lesions) were studied with {18F-fluorodeoxyglucose} ({FDG)} {PET} before planned resective pancreatic surgery. Nineteen of 171 patients had elevated plasma glucose levels above 130 mg/dl, and 24 of 171 had diabetes mellitus. Standard uptake values ({SUVs)} with and without glucose correction, tumor-to-muscle ratios and tumor-to-liver ratios were measured of the pancreatic lesion respective of the area with the highest uptake within the pancreas. The original qualitative {PET} reports concerning the dignity of the pancreatic lesion were translated into a five-point malignancy scale. Tumor detection rates and {SUVs} were compared according to plasma glucose levels above and below 130 mg/dl, the presence of diabetes and by using receiver operating characteristic ({ROC)} analysis.


{RESULTS}

The detection rates (and mean {SUVs)} for pancreatic malignancies were 86\% and 42\% (4.2 and 2.3) if fasted plasma glucose levels were below and above 130 mg/dl, respectively. The sensitivities (and mean {SUVs} of malignant tumors) were 83\% and 69\% (3.3 and 2.5) for patients without and with known diabetes. Areas under {ROC} curves were nearly equal for glucose corrected {SUV} and visual qualitative results (0.86 and 0.85), followed by uncorrected {SUV} (0.83), tumor-to-liver ratios (0.80) and tumor-to-muscle ratios (0.79). {SUVs} for chronic pancreatitis, muscle and liver had a tendency to increase with elevated plasma glucose levels.


{CONCLUSION}

Negative {PET} results of patients with elevated plasma glucose should be interpreted with caution.},

	abstract = {The detection of pancreatic cancer or the discrimination between pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis remains an important diagnostic problem. The increased glucose metabolism in malignant tumours formed the basis for this investigation, which focused on the role of positron emission tomography ({PET)} with 2[{18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose} ({FDG)} in the detection of pancreatic cancer and its differentiation from chronic pancreatitis. Eighty patients admitted for elective pancreatic surgery received preoperatively 250-350 {mBq} {FDG} intravenously and emission scans were recorded 45 minutes later. Intense focal activity in the pancreatic region was taken at the time of scanning as showing the presence of pancreatic cancer. The presence of cancer was later confirmed by histological examination of the surgical specimens and histological findings were compared with the preoperative {PET} results. Forty one patients with pancreatic cancer (group I: n = 42) had a focally increased {FDG} uptake in the pancreatic region. Two patients with a periampullary carcinoma (group {II:} n = 6) failed to develop {FDG} accumulation. In 28 patients with chronic pancreatitis (group {III:} n = 32) no {FDG} accumulation occurred. Overall sensitivity and specificity of {PET} for malignancy (group I + {II)} were 94\% (45 of 48) and 88\% (28 of 32), respectively. The standard uptake value of the patients with pancreatic carcinoma was significantly higher than in patients with chronic pancreatitis (3.09 (2.18) v 0.87 (0.56); p {\textless} 0.001; median (interquartile range)). These findings show that {FDG-PET} represents a new and non-invasive diagnostic procedure for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and to differentiate pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis. However, the diagnostic potential of this technique requires further evaluation.},

	abstract = {{UNLABELLED}

The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of [{18F]2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose} ({FDG)} positron emission tomography ({PET)} in patients with a pancreatic mass by comparing the results with those of X-ray computed tomography ({CT)} and magnetic resonance ({MR)} imaging.


{METHODS}

Eighty-six patients with pancreatic lesions, included 65 malignant tumors and 21 benign masses (55 masses were proven histologically and the others were diagnosed clinically), were studied. The diagnostic factors of {CT} and {MR} imaging were evaluated, and those of {FDG} {PET} were also evaluated for malignant and benign masses by visual interpretation and quantitative interpretation with the standardized uptake value ({SUV)} and {SUVgluc} which was designed to reduce the effects of a high blood sugar level. Visual interpretations were evaluated only in {FDG} {PET} images, and quantitative interpretations were evaluated by referring to {CT} and/or {MR} imaging. The correlation between {SUV} and the degree of histological differentiation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma was investigated.


{RESULTS}

Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value ({PPV)}, negative predictive value ({NPV)} and accuracy for {CT} imaging were 91, 62, 88, 68 and 84\%, and for {MR} imaging 78, 70, 88, 54 and 76\%, respectively. In visual interpretation of {FDG} {PET} images, the sensitivity, specificity, {PPV}, {NPV} and accuracy were 82, 81, 93, 59 and 81\%, respectively. Significant differences between malignant and benign lesions existed in {SUV} and {SUVgluc} (p {\textless} 0.0001, each). With the cutoff value of {SUV} as 2.1 and {SUVgluc} as 2.2, the accuracy of diagnosis was maximal. With that cutoff value, the sensitivity, specificity, {PPV}, {NPV} and accuracy for {SUV} were 89, 76, 92, 70 and 86\%, and for {SUVgluc} 91, 76, 92, 73 and 87\%, respectively. The sensitivity and {NPV} of {SUVgluc} were higher than those of {SUV}, which suggests that {SUVgluc} may be more useful in reducing the number of overlooked malignant tumors. The specificity and {PPV} of {FDG} {PET} were superior to those of {CT} and {MR} imaging. There were no significant differences between the {SUVs} of moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas and those of well differentiated adenocarcinomas.


{CONCLUSION}

To improve the diagnostic procedure for classifying masses, {FDG} {PET} with not only {SUV} but also {SUV} corrected by the blood sugar level is required in addition to morphological diagnosis by {CT} and/or {MR} imaging.},
