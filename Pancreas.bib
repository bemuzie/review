	abstract = {The fate of a patient with acute pancreatitis largely depends on early recognition of the severity of the disease. Acute pancreatitis is severe when organ failure and/or pancreatic necrosis occur. Whereas simple and low cost parameters are available for the detection of organ failure, the detection and extent of pancreatic necrosis requires a costly contrast-enhanced computed tomography. This is not always available in all institutions. This review article which considers when the clinician should be concerned about his patient diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, summarizes possibilities for diagnosing clinical severe (that is organ failure) and radiological severe (that is the necrotizing form of the disease) pancreatitis using simple and inexpensive parameters which are available everywhere. At present, a {CT} scan should be performed in those patients with alcohol etiology, those admitted to hospital early (time interval between the onset of symptoms and admission to hospital of less than 24 h, those presenting with rebound tenderness and/or guarding, a lipase {\textgreater}1,000 U/l, as well as a raised hematocrit and blood glucose. The evaluation, furthermore, shows that some parameters have a sufficiently high negative predictive value of {\textgreater}90\%, which may render a contrast-enhanced {CT} scan unnecessary in the early stages, unless the patient fails to improve. These parameters include non-alcohol etiology, time interval between onset and admission to hospital longer than 24 h, no guarding or rebound tenderness on admission, low or normal hematocrit and nonelevated blood glucose. It is necessary to look further on simple low cost and more valid parameters on admission in order to reliably distinguish between necrotizing pancreatitis and interstitial pancreatitis.},

The lag period between diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer is usually one or two decades: pancreatitis appearing a year or two before the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is often the result of tumour-related ductal obstruction. The risk of developing pancreatic cancer appears to be highest in rare types of pancreatitis with an early onset, such as hereditary pancreatitis and tropical pancreatitis. Even though there is a strong link between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, over a 20 year period only around five percent of patients with chronic pancreatitis will develop pancreatic cancer.

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION}

Survival after surgery of pancreatic cancer is still poor, even after curative resection. Some prognostic factors like the status of the resection margin, lymph node ({LN)} status, or tumor grading have been identified. However, only few data have been published regarding the prognostic influence of the {LN} ratio (number of {LN} involved to number of examined {LN).} We, therefore, evaluated potential prognostic factors in 182 patients after resection of pancreatic cancer including assessment of {LN} ratio.


{METHODS}

Since 1994, 204 patients underwent pancreatic resection for ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Survival was evaluated in 182 patients with complete follow-up evaluations. Of those 182 patients, 88\% had cancer of the pancreatic head, 5\% of the body, and 7\% of the pancreatic tail. Patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy (85\%), distal resection (12\%), or total pancreatectomy (3\%). Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier and Cox methods.


{RESULTS}

In all 204 resected patients, operative mortality was 3.9\% (n = 8). In the 182 patients with follow-up, 70\% had free resection margins, 62\% had G1- or G2-classified tumors, and 70\% positive {LN.} Median tumor size was 30 (7-80) mm. The median number of examined {LN} was 16 and median number of involved {LN} 1 (range 0-22). Median {LN} ratio was 0.1 (0-0.79). Cumulative 5-year survival (5-year {SV)} in all patients was 15\%. In univariate analysis, a {LN} ratio {\textgreater} or = 0.2 (5-year {SV} 6\% vs. 19\% with {LN} ratio {\textless} 0.2; p = 0.003), {LN} ratio {\textgreater} or = 0.3 (5-year {SV} 0\% vs. 18\% with {LN} ratio {\textless} 0.3; p {\textless} 0.001), a positive resection margin (p {\textless} 0.01) and poor differentiation ({G3/G4;} p {\textless} 0.03) were associated with poorer survival. In multivariate analysis, a {LN} ratio {\textgreater} or = 0.2 (p {\textless} 0.02; relative risk {RR} 1.6), {LN} ratio {\textgreater} or = 0.3 (p {\textless} 0.001; {RR} 2.2), positive margins (p {\textless} 0.02; {RR} 1.7), and poor differentiation (p {\textless} 0.03; {RR} 1.5) were independent factors predicting a poorer outcome. The conventional nodal status or the number of examined nodes (in all patients and in the subgroups of node positive or negative patients) had no significant influence on survival. Patients with one metastatic {LN} had the same outcome as patients with negative nodes, but prognosis decreased significantly in patients with two or more {LN} involved.


{CONCLUSIONS}

Not the lymph node involvement per se but especially the {LN} ratio is an independent prognostic factor after resection of pancreatic cancers. In our series, the {LN} ratio was even the strongest predictor of survival. The routine estimation of the {LN} ratio may be helpful not only for the individual prediction of prognosis but also for the indication of adjuvant therapy and herein related outcome and therapy studies.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} To define the duct-penetrating sign at magnetic resonance ({MR)} cholangiopancreatography ({MRCP)} and to assess the usefulness of this sign for distinguishing an inflammatory pancreatic mass ({IPM)} from a conventional pancreatic carcinoma ({CPC)} compared with arterial phase computed tomography (hereafter, {CT)} and arterial phase {MR} imaging (hereafter, {MR} imaging).
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} {MRCP}, {CT}, and {MR} images were compared by means of receiver operating characteristic ({ROC)} analysis for 11 {IPMs} and 43 {CPCs.} With the {MRCP} images, a morphologic classification of the main pancreatic duct ({MPD)} was attempted for all lesions. On the basis of this classification and the enhancement patterns of a lesion, all readers graded the presence of {IPM} or {CPC} on a five-point scale for all images.
{RESULTS:} On the {MRCP} images, the morphologic characteristics of the {MPD} were nonobstruction for {IPM} (28 of 33, 85\%) and obstruction or irregular stenosis for {CPC} (124 of 129, 96\%). At {ROC} analysis among all the techniques, {MRCP} images had the highest value (0.98) for significant areas under the {ROC} curve ({CT}, 0.84; {MR}, 0.76) (P {\textless} .001). For the duct-penetrating sign in the broad sense (nonobstructed {MPD)} and the sign in the narrow sense (only normal {MPD)}, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for diagnosis of {IPM} were 85\%, 96\%, and 94\%, respectively, and 36\%, 100\%, and 87\%, respectively.
{CONCLUSION:} The duct-penetrating sign on {MRCP} images was more helpful to distinguish {IPM} from {CPC} than were the enhancement patterns on {CT} and {MR} images.},

These anomalies may simulate various neoplastic, inflammatory, and posttraumatic conditions and should be part of the differential diagnosis for a variety of abnormalities found at diagnostic imaging. Anatomic variants, developmental anomalies (eg, pancreas divisum, annular pancreas, ectopic pancreas, pancreatic agenesis and hypoplasia), and congenital diseases (congenital pancreatic cysts, von {Hippel–Lindau} disease, choledochal cysts), in addition to potential imaging pitfalls (uneven distribution of fat, “pseudomasses”), can all pose a diagnostic challenge for the radiologist. Familiarity with these anomalies, the imaging techniques available for their study, and their variable imaging manifestations is necessary for differentiating them from other biliary and pancreatic conditions. A basic understanding of the embryologic development and normal anatomy of the pancreas and biliary tree is also essential for identifying these anomalies.© {RSNA}, 2006},

According to a multivariate analysis, lymph node metastasis, intrapancreatic perineural invasion, and portal vein invasion were significant prognostic factors. Subsequently, a subgroup analysis concerning nodal metastasis and intrapancreatic perineural invasion was performed in 126 patients with records of these histological findings. In the group of patients without nodal metastasis, the 5-year survival rate for those without perineural invasion was 75\%, whereas that for those with perineural invasion was 29\%, the difference in survival of these subgroups being significant (P {\textless} 0.02). In the group of patients with nodal metastasis, the 5-year survival rate for those without perineural invasion was 17\%, while that for those with perineural invasion was 10\%. The most favorable 5-year survival of 89\% was observed in the subgroup of patients with stage I disease without perineural invasion. Thus, pancreatic adenocarcinoma categorized by the combination of these independent types of biological behavior showed 5-year survival rates ranging from very high to low, indicating that these two factors play an important role in the prognosis of this disease.},

Computed tomography ({CT)} is the most widely available and best-validated modality for imaging patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. To maximize the diagnostic efficacy of {CT}, use of a pancreas protocol is mandatory. The sensitivity of {CT} for diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (89\%-97\%) and its positive predictive value for predicting unresectability (89\%-100\%) are high. The positive predictive value of {CT} for predicting resectability (45\%-79\%) is low because the diagnostic criteria for diagnosing vascular invasion by tumor favors specificity over sensitivity to avoid denying surgery to patients with potentially resectable tumor. Furthermore, the sensitivity of {CT} for small hepatic and peritoneal metastases is limited. Magnetic resonance imaging has not been shown to perform better than {CT} for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but can be helpful as an adjunct to {CT}, particularly for evaluation of small hepatic lesions that cannot be fully characterized by {CT.} Ultrasound is often the first study obtained in patients with obstructive jaundice or unexplained abdominal pain, but its utility for diagnosis and staging of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma is limited. Positron emission {tomography/CT} combines the functional information provided by positron emission tomography with the anatomic information provided by {CT} and is a promising modality for imaging of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but its utility has not been established.

Abdominal {US} is the modality often used first to identify a cause of abdominal pain or jaundice, while the accuracy of conventional {US} for diagnosing pancreatic tumors is only 50–70\%. {CT} is the most widely used imaging examination for the detection and staging of pancreatic carcinoma. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is generally depicted as a hypoattenuating area on contrast-enhanced {CT.} The reported sensitivity of helical {CT} in revealing pancreatic carcinoma is high, ranging between 89\% and 97\%. Multi-detector-row ({MD)} {CT} may offer an improvement in the early detection and accurate staging of pancreatic carcinoma. It should be taken into consideration that some pancreatic adenocarcinomas are depicted as isoattenuating and that pancreatitis accompanied by pancreatic adenocarcinoma might occasionally result in the overestimation of staging. T1-weighted spin-echo images with fat suppression and dynamic gradient-echo {MR} images enhanced with gadolinium have been reported to be superior to helical {CT} for detecting small lesions. However, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma are not distinguished on the basis of degree and time of enhancement on dynamic gadolinium-enhanced {MRI.} {EUS} is superior to spiral {CT} and {MRI} in the detection of small tumors, and can also localize lymph node metastases or vascular tumor infiltration with high sensitivity. {EUS-guided} fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a safe and highly accurate method for tissue diagnosis of patients with suspected pancreatic carcinoma. {18F-fluorodeoxyglucose} ({FDG)} positron emission tomography ({PET)} has been suggested as a promising modality for noninvasive differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. Previous studies reported the sensitivity and specificity of {FDG-PET} for detecting malignant pancreatic tumors as being 71–100\% and 64–90\%, respectively. {FDG-PET} does not replace, but is complementary to morphologic imaging, and therefore, in doubtful cases, the method must be combined with other imaging modalities.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

It is well known that pancreatic cancer is rarely cured and is usually fatal. The clinicopathological features of small (greatest dimension {\textless} or = 2 cm by histologic measurement) carcinoma of the pancreas (s-{PC)}, were reviewed, paying special attention to new computed tomography ({CT)} finding that suggests the presence of s-{PC.}


{METHODOLOGY}

Sixteen patients with s-{PC} have undergone curative surgery at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital during the past 11 years. Their preoperative diagnostic findings, pathological findings and postoperative prognoses were analyzed.


{RESULTS}

The most useful diagnostic clue was dilatation of the main pancreatic duct ({MPD).} It was difficult to identify the tumor in four patients because of pancreatitis accompanying the {MPD} obstruction. In three of these four cases, early phase-enhanced {CT} revealed a contrasting effect between the proximal and distal sides of the pancreatic parenchyma at the site of the {MPD} obstruction (black \& white sign). The longest diameters of the tumors ranged from 0.9 to 2 cm (average 1.3 cm). Positive rates of capsular invasion, retroperitoneal invasion, and lymph node metastasis were 6.3\% (1/16), 31.3\% (5/16), and 18.8\% (3/16), respectively. Six patients (37.5\%) were classed at stage I, six (37.5\%) stage {II}, three (18.8\%) stage {III}, and one (6.2\%) at stage {IV} according to pathological {TNM} classification. One patient died of the disease, and the cumulative 3- and 5-year survival rates were 88.9\% and 59.3\%, respectively.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The presence of s-{PC} qualifies as early {PC} and has a good prognosis. The {CT} black + white sign will be useful in the diagnosis of s-{PC} accompanying pancreatitis.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT}

It is important to recognize arterial variants in the preoperative planning of extended pancreatic resections. The absence of surgical confirmation of radiological data is a limitation of the majority of angiographic or {CT-angiographic} studies of celiac and mesenteric arterial anatomy.


{OBJECTIVE}

The purpose of this study was to test the accuracy of {CT} angiography in delineating the arterial architecture by comparing the resultant {3D} images with findings at surgery and determining the frequency of different celiac and mesenteric arterial anatomy variants.


{METHODS}

Abdominal {CT} angiographies of 350 patients were performed on a 64- and 256-{MDCT} scanner prior to major pancreatic or hepatobiliary surgery. Variants of celiac and mesenteric arterial anatomy were documented as {3D} reconstructions. Radiological data were compared to operative photographs during extended pancreaticoduodenectomies and extended distal pancreatectomies in 59 cases.


{RESULTS}

Only 197 patients (56.3\%) had the classic arterial anatomy identified at {CT} angiography. The most common variants were a replaced or accessory right hepatic artery originating from the superior mesenteric artery (62 cases, 17.7\%) and a replaced or accessory left hepatic artery (43 cases, 12.3\%) originating from the left gastric artery. According to a comparison with operative photographs, {CT} angiography demonstrated 100\% accuracy in identifying celiac and mesenteric arterial anatomy variants, stenoses, obstructions and aneurysms of the celiac and mesenteric branches, including those which were hemodynamically significant and which influence the choice and sequence of operative procedures.


{CONCLUSION}

The celiac and mesenteric arterial anatomy variants are fairly common and are of great significance in planning extended pancreatic resections. Radiological findings were fully corroborated by operative data, which means that {CT} angiography is a reliable tool for identifying celiac and mesenteric arterial anatomy aberrations and arterial lesions.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Fifty-three patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma underwent contrast material–enhanced biphasic multi–detector row {CT} with curved planar reformation. Tumors were initially deemed isoattenuating or hypoattenuating to normal pancreatic parenchyma on the basis of visual inspection, and the degree of attenuation was confirmed by calculating the mean attenuation differences between normal pancreatic parenchyma and tumor (tumor-pancreas contrast) during the pancreatic phase. Indirect signs of pancreatic tumor were tabulated in patients with an isoattenuating tumor.
{RESULTS:} Of the 53 patients, six (11\%) had isoattenuating tumors with a mean tumor-pancreas contrast of 9.25 {HU} ± 11.3 during the pancreatic phase and 4.15 {HU} ± 8.5 during the portal venous phase. The secondary signs of pancreatic tumor in these six patients included an interrupted pancreatic duct (n = 5), dilated biliary and pancreatic ducts (n = 1), atrophic distal pancreatic parenchyma (n = 3), and mass effect and/or convex contour abnormality (n = 3). The mean tumor-pancreas contrast for the remaining 47 patients was 74.76 {HU} ± 35.61 during the pancreatic phase.
{CONCLUSION:} With no visible tumor-pancreas contrast for isoattenuating tumors, indirect signs such as mass effect, atrophic distal parenchyma, and an interrupted duct sign are important indicators for the presence of tumor.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

The results of case-control studies and anecdotal reports suggest that pancreatitis may be a risk factor for pancreatic cancer, but there have been no studies of sufficient size and power to assess the magnitude of the relation between these two diseases.


{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}

We undertook a multicenter historical cohort study of 2015 subjects with chronic pancreatitis who were recruited from clinical centers in six countries. A total of 56 cancers were identified among these patients during a mean (+/-{SD)} follow-up of 7.4 +/- 6.2 years. The expected number of cases of cancer calculated from country-specific incidence data and adjusted for age and sex was 2.13, yielding a standardized incidence ratio (the ratio of observed to expected cases) of 26.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 19.9 to 34.2). For subjects with a minimum of two or five years of follow-up, the respective standardized incidence ratios were 16.5 (95 percent confidence interval, 11.1 to 23.7) and 14.4 (95 percent confidence interval, 8.5 to 22.8). The cumulative risk of pancreatic cancer in subjects who were followed for at least 2 years increased steadily, and 10 and 20 years after the diagnosis of pancreatitis, it was 1.8 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 2.6 percent) and 4.0 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 2.0 to 5.9 percent), respectively.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The risk of pancreatic cancer is significantly elevated in subjects with chronic pancreatitis and appears to be independent of sex, country, and type of pancreatitis.},

Preoperative staging and assessment can be performed with a number of modalities. Multidetector (64-section) volumetric computed tomography ({CT)} allows rapid anatomic coverage coupled with excellent spatial resolution. Understanding the technical parameters necessary for successful pancreatic {CT} angiography is crucial. Carefully timed scan acquisition maximizes the difference in attenuation between the neoplasm and the pancreatic parenchyma and allows accurate local and distant staging as well as assessment of local resectability. In addition, angiographic data sets can be rendered to create displays of the local venous and arterial anatomy that are familiar to surgeons. Advanced rendering can also be used to create pancreaticographic type images. The {TNM} system of staging for pancreatic adenocarcinoma is not frequently included in radiology reporting but is important for deciding on optimal therapy and neoadjuvant therapy.© {RSNA}, 2007},

	abstract = {{AIM}

To evaluate the ability of the time-signal intensity curve ({TIC)} of the pancreas obtained from dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} for differentiation of focal pancreatic masses, especially pancreatic carcinoma coexisting with chronic pancreatitis and tumor-forming pancreatitis.


{METHODS}

Forty-eight consecutive patients who underwent surgery for a focal pancreatic mass, including pancreatic ductal carcinoma (n=33), tumor-forming pancreatitis (n=8), and islet cell tumor (n=7), were reviewed. Five pancreatic carcinomas coexisted with longstanding chronic pancreatitis. The pancreatic {TICs} were obtained from the pancreatic mass and the pancreatic parenchyma both proximal and distal to the mass lesion in each patient, prior to surgery, and were classified into 4 types according to the time to a peak: 25 s and 1, 2, and 3 min after the bolus injection of contrast material, namely, type-I, {II}, {III}, and {IV}, respectively, and were then compared to the corresponding histological pancreatic conditions.


{RESULTS}

Pancreatic carcinomas demonstrated type-{III} (n=13) or {IV} (n=20) {TIC.} Tumor-forming pancreatitis showed type-{II} (n=5) or {III} (n=3) {TIC.} All islet cell tumors revealed type-I. The type-{IV} {TIC} was only recognized in pancreatic carcinoma, and the {TIC} of carcinoma always depicted the slowest rise to a peak among the 3 pancreatic {TICs} measured in each patient, even in patients with chronic pancreatitis.


{CONCLUSION}

Pancreatic {TIC} from dynamic {MRI} provides reliable information for distinguishing pancreatic carcinoma from other pancreatic masses, and may enable us to avoid unnecessary pancreatic surgery and delays in making a correct diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma, especially, in patients with longstanding chronic pancreatitis.},

Nonneoplastic lesions include focal pancreatitis, fatty infiltration-replacement, intrapancreatic accessory spleen, congenital anomalies such as prominent pancreatic lobulation and bifid pancreatic tail (pancreatic bifidum), and rare miscellaneous lesions (eg, pancreatic sarcoidosis, Castleman disease of the pancreas). A variety of imaging modalities are available for assessing these solid lesions, including ultrasonography ({US)}, computed tomography ({CT)}, magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic {US}, and hybrid nuclear imaging techniques such as single photon emission computed {tomography–CT} and positron emission {tomography–CT}, each of which has its own strengths and limitations.

From January 2002 through September 2009, the authors reviewed the clinical and imaging data of 130 consecutive patients (76 men, 54 women; mean age, 64.1 years; age range, 28–82 years) who had surgically proven 30-mm-diameter or smaller pancreatic cancers and underwent preoperative multidetector {CT} and 33 consecutive patients (17 men, 16 women; mean age, 65.1 years; age range, 48–84 years) who had histopathologically proven pancreatic cancer and underwent incidental multidetector {CT} before the diagnosis was rendered. Only pancreatic phase {CT} was performed in two patients, and only hepatic venous phase {CT} was performed in nine patients. Two radiologists in consensus classified the tumor attenuation as hyper-, iso-, or hypoattenuation during the pancreatic and hepatic venous phases. Accompanying secondary signs, temporal changes in tumor attenuation, and histopathologic findings also were analyzed. The Fisher exact test, χ2 test, generalized estimating equation, and Student t test were used to compare the {variables.Results:} Seventy tumors were 20 mm or smaller, and 93 were 21–30 mm. Isoattenuating pancreatic cancers were more commonly observed among the 20-mm or smaller tumors (16 of 59, 27\%) than among the 21–30-mm tumors (12 of 93, 13\%) (P = .033). They were also more common among well-differentiated tumors (seven of 12, 58\%) than among moderately differentiated (20 of 124, 16\%) and poorly differentiated (one of 10, 10\%) tumors (P = .001). The prevalence of secondary signs differed significantly according to tumor size (53 [76\%] of 70 ≤20-mm tumors vs 92 [99\%] of 93 21–30-mm tumors) (P {\textless} .001). The prevalence of secondary signs was high among isoattenuating pancreatic cancers (14 [88\%] of 16 ≤20-mm tumors vs all 12 [100\%] 21–30-mm tumors). Most of the isoattenuating tumors seen at prediagnostic {CT} were hypoattenuating after 6 months (100\% [four of four] during pancreatic phase, 71\% [five of seven] during hepatic venous {phase).Conclusion:} The prevalence of isoattenuating pancreatic cancers differed significantly according to tumor size and cellular differentiation. Most small isoattenuating pancreatic cancers showed secondary signs.© {RSNA}, {2011Supplemental} material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101133/-{/DC1}},

This study evaluates images of early pancreatic cancer on multidetector {CT} ({MDCT)} using contrast-enhanced multiphasic imaging, and post-processed pancreatic duct images. {CT} findings and pathological features were analysed in eight patients with early pancreatic cancer. Pathological evaluation included location, size and histological grading of the tumour. {MDCT} evaluation covered the maximum diameter of the main pancreatic duct ({MPD)}, stenosis or obstruction of the {MPD}, loss of normal lobar texture and associated pancreatitis. Attenuation differences between normal pancreatic parenchyma and the tumour ({AD-PT)} were also measured. Focal stenosis or obstruction of the {MPD} with dilatation of the distal {MPD} was demonstrated in all patients. Associated pancreatitis occurred in six patients with tumours measuring 12 mm or greater. Loss of normal lobar texture was recognised in four cases with the tumour measuring 14 mm or greater. Statistically, low-attenuated lesions and high-attenuated lesions differed with respect to the tumour size (p{\textless}0.01), and a positive relationship was demonstrated between the tumour size and {AD-PT} (r = 0.84). In seven cases, {AD-PT} is higher during the arterial phase than the pancreatic phase. Early pancreatic cancer appears as low attenuation on early phase, and as high- to iso-attenuation during the pancreatic and delayed phases in respect to the tumour size. Focal stenosis or obstruction of the {MPD} with dilatation of the distal {MPD} observed on curved reformation imaging seems important in the diagnosis of early pancreatic cancer.},

Few studies have evaluated large numbers of patients treated with this technique, and in recent years the emphasis has been on more limited surgery for pancreatic cancer. {METHODS:} Fifty-six patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head were treated by regional subtotal or total pancreatectomy. Clinical and pathologic parameters were reviewed and potential prognostic factors were compared statistically. The three patients who died within 30 days of the operation were excluded from the survival analysis. {RESULTS:} Primary tumor size was the strongest determinant of prognosis. The mean tumor size was 3.9 cm (range, 1-7 cm). Eighty-five percent of patients had peripancreatic soft tissue invasion microscopically, and 58\% had regional lymph node metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated a 33\% 5-year survival for patients with tumor 2.5 cm or less in diameter (n=12) and 12\% for patients with larger tumors (n=39). No patient with a tumor larger than 5 cm survived more than 5 years. Mean tumor size was not significantly associated with lymph node metastases, but 5 of 12 patients (42\%) with primary tumor {\textless} or =2.5 cm had lymph node metastases. Twenty-four percent of patients with negative lymph nodes and 14\% with positive lymph nodes survived 5 years. The difference was not statistically significant (p=0.3), but this is likely related to sample size. The 30- day operative mortality was 5.3\%. The most common complications were infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and gastric stasis. {CONCLUSIONS:} After regional pancreatectomy, tumor size is the strongest predictor of prognosis. A multi- institutional randomized prospective trial of regional pancreatectomy versus pancreaticoduodenectomy is warranted in previously untreated, noninfected cases.},

Subtypes of collateral pathways via the dorsal pancreatic artery include a longitudinal pathway between the celiac branches and the {SMA} or its branches and a transverse pathway to either the splenic or gastroduodenal artery. A communicating channel between the right hepatic artery and the {SMA} can be a route for collateral circulation. Hepatic artery variants cause the development of unique collateral pathways that have different characteristics depending on the type of variant. These collateral pathways include intrahepatic interlobar collateral vessels, right gastric to left gastric arterial anastomoses, left hepatic to left gastric arterial anastomoses, and peribiliary arterial plexuses. Major collateral pathways in patients with celiac axis stenosis can be identified with spiral {CT}, and knowledge concerning this collateral circulation may be important for certain medical procedures such as interventional procedures for the management of hepatic tumors, pancreaticobiliary surgery, and liver transplantation.© {RSNA}, 2002},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}

The angiographic appearance of acute necrotizing pancreatitis ({ANP)} demonstrates ischemic change with vasospasm in and around the pancreas. We investigated the role of vasospasm in pancreatic ischemia and necrosis in the early phase of human {ANP.}


{METHODS}

The relationship between the angiographic abnormalities and the perfusion status of the pancreas documented by contrast-enhanced computed tomography ({CE-CT)} was examined in 102 patients with {ANP} who were admitted during the early phase of the disease.


{RESULTS}

Ischemic change with vasospasm on angiography of the intrapancreatic and extrapancreatic arteries was observed and corresponded with the poorly perfused area of the pancreas detected by {CE-CT} done at admission. Resultant pancreatic necrosis was confirmed on follow-up {CE-CT} examination consistent with the location where angiography demonstrated ischemic change with vasospasm. Severe ischemic change on angiography was primarily observed in patients in whom more than 50\% of the pancreas was poorly perfused. The extent of the ischemic change was correlated with the extent of the poorly perfused area of the pancreas and the mortality rate.


{CONCLUSION}

These results suggest that vasospasm is involved in the development of pancreatic ischemia and necrosis in the early phase of {ANP.}},

Two radiologists blinded to the pathologic assessment of malignancy or parenchymal invasion of {IPMN} retrospectively evaluated {CT} images of 61 consecutive surgically resected tumors (26 adenomas, 15 noninvasive carcinomas, and 20 invasive carcinomas) in patients who underwent multiphase contrast material–enhanced {CT} with 0.5- or 1-mm collimation. The findings were statistically analyzed by using univariate and multivariate analyses, with the optimal cutoff levels of each continuous parameter determined by generating receiver operating characteristic {curves.Results:} The following findings showed significant differences among the three groups: maximum diameter of the main pancreatic duct ({MPD)}, size (length of major axis) of the largest mural nodule in the {MPD} or in any associated cystic lesion, abnormal attenuating area in the surrounding parenchyma, calcification in the lesion, protrusion of the {MPD} into the ampulla of Vater, and bile duct dilatation. An {MPD} diameter of 6 mm or larger, a mural nodule of 3 mm or larger, and an abnormal attenuating area were independently predictive of malignancy. A mural nodule of 6.3 mm or larger in the {MPD} and an abnormal attenuating area were independently predictive of parenchymal invasion. According to these criteria, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for identifying malignancy were 83\%, 81\%, and 82\% and for identifying parenchymal invasion were 90\%, 88\%, and 89\%, {respectively.Conclusion:} Multisection {CT} is useful for distinguishing among adenoma, noninvasive carcinoma, and invasive carcinoma in patients with {IPMN.©} {RSNA}, 2008},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE.} The purpose of this study was to compare mangafodipir trisodium—enhanced {MR} imaging performed with a phased array coil and contrast-enhanced single-detector helical {CT} for accuracy in the detection and local staging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and in the differentiation between cancer and focal pancreatitis.
{SUBJECTS} {AND} {METHODS.} Forty-two patients with suspected pancreatic masses underwent contrast-enhanced helical {CT} and mangafodipir trisodium—enhanced {MR} imaging at 1.5 T. The images were assessed for the presence or absence of tumors; characterization of masses; and presence of vascular invasion, lymph node metastases, or liver metastases. Imaging findings were correlated with findings at laparotomy, laparoscopy, biopsy, or follow-up.
{RESULTS.} Focal masses were present in 36 patients (cancer, n = 26; focal pancreatitis, n = 7; other, n = 3). The sensitivity for lesion detection of {MR} imaging was 100\% and of {CT}, 94\%. Two small malignant lesions were missed on {CT.} For the diagnosis of tumor nonresectability, the sensitivity of {MR} imaging and {CT} was 90\% and 80\%, respectively. Liver metastases were missed on {MR} imaging in one of the eight patients and on {CT} in four. For differentiation between adenocarcinoma and nonadenocarcinoma, the sensitivity of {MR} imaging was 100\% (positive predictive value, 90\%; negative predictive value, 100\%), and the sensitivity of {CT} was 92\% (positive predictive value, 80\%; negative predictive value, 67\%). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the mean area under the curve for {MR} imaging was 0.920 and for {CT}, 0.832 (not significant).
{CONCLUSION.} Mangafodipir trisodium—enhanced {MR} imaging is as accurate as contrast-enhanced helical {CT} for the detection and staging of pancreatic cancer but offers improved detection of small pancreatic metastases and of liver metastases compared with {CT.}},

At surgical exploration, however, only 5\% to 25\% of the tumors are amenable to resection (5 - 8). Therefore, the principle goal of preoperative evaluation is to identify patients with potentially resectable disease while avoiding surgical exploration in those with unresectable disease.},

	volume = {229},
	issn = {0003-4932},
	url = {http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1420818/},
	abstract = {Objective
To assess the accuracy and clinical impact of 18fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography ({18FDG-PET)} on the management of patients with suspected primary or recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and to assess the utility of {18FDG-PET} in grading tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation.

Summary Background Data
The diagnosis, staging, and treatment of pancreatic cancer remain difficult. Small primary tumors and hepatic metastases are often not well visualized by computed tomographic scanning ({CT)}, resulting in a high incidence of nontherapeutic celiotomy and the frequent need for “blind resection.” In addition, the distinction between local recurrence and nonspecific postoperative changes after resection can be difficult to ascertain on standard anatomic imaging. {18FDG-PET} is a new imaging technique that takes advantage of increased glucose metabolism by tumor cells and may improve the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative studies for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Methods
Eighty-one {18FDG-PET} scans were obtained in 70 patients undergoing evaluation for suspected primary or recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Of this group, 65 underwent evaluation for suspected primary pancreatic cancer. Nine patients underwent {18FDG-PET} imaging before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiation, and in eight patients {18FDG-PET} scans were performed for possible recurrent adenocarcinoma after resection. The {18FDG-PET} images were analyzed visually and semiquantitatively using the standard uptake ratio ({SUR).} The sensitivity and specificity of {18FDG-PET} and {CT} were determined for evaluation of the preoperative diagnosis of primary pancreatic carcinoma, and the impact of {18FDG-PET} on patient management was retrospectively assessed.

Results
Among the 65 patients evaluated for primary tumor, 52 had proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 13 had benign lesions. {18FDG-PET} had a higher sensitivity and specificity than {CT} in correctly diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma (92\% and 85\% vs. 65\% and 62\%). Eighteen patients (28\%) had indeterminate or unrecognized pancreatic masses on {CT} clarified with {18FDG-PET.} Seven patients (11\%) had indeterminate or unrecognized metastatic disease clarified with {18FDG-PET.} Overall, {18FDG-PET} suggested potential alterations in clinical management in 28/65 patients (43\%) with suspected primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Of the nine patients undergoing {18FDG-PET} imaging before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiation, four had evidence of tumor regression by {PET}, three showed stable disease, and two showed tumor progression. {CT} was unable to detect any response to neoadjuvant therapy in this group. Eight patients had {18FDG-PET} scans to evaluate suspected recurrent disease after resection. Four were noted to have new regions of {18FDG-uptake} in the resection bed; four had evidence of new hepatic metastases. All proved to have metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Conclusions
These data confirm that {18FDG-PET} is useful in the evaluation of patients with suspected primary or recurrent pancreatic carcinoma. {18FDG-PET} is more sensitive and specific than {CT} in the detection of small primary tumors and in the clarification of hepatic and distant metastases. {18FDG-PET} was also of benefit in assessing response to neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Although {18FDG-PET} cannot replace {CT} in defining local tumor resectability, the application of {18FDG-PET} in addition to {CT} may alter clinical management in a significant fraction of patients with suspected pancreatic cancer.},

The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of elevated plasma glucose levels on tumor detection.


{METHODS}

One-hundred and seventy-one fasted patients (100 malignant pancreatic tumors, 46 chronic pancreatitis and 25 patients with other benign pancreatic lesions) were studied with {18F-fluorodeoxyglucose} ({FDG)} {PET} before planned resective pancreatic surgery. Nineteen of 171 patients had elevated plasma glucose levels above 130 mg/dl, and 24 of 171 had diabetes mellitus. Standard uptake values ({SUVs)} with and without glucose correction, tumor-to-muscle ratios and tumor-to-liver ratios were measured of the pancreatic lesion respective of the area with the highest uptake within the pancreas. The original qualitative {PET} reports concerning the dignity of the pancreatic lesion were translated into a five-point malignancy scale. Tumor detection rates and {SUVs} were compared according to plasma glucose levels above and below 130 mg/dl, the presence of diabetes and by using receiver operating characteristic ({ROC)} analysis.


{RESULTS}

The detection rates (and mean {SUVs)} for pancreatic malignancies were 86\% and 42\% (4.2 and 2.3) if fasted plasma glucose levels were below and above 130 mg/dl, respectively. The sensitivities (and mean {SUVs} of malignant tumors) were 83\% and 69\% (3.3 and 2.5) for patients without and with known diabetes. Areas under {ROC} curves were nearly equal for glucose corrected {SUV} and visual qualitative results (0.86 and 0.85), followed by uncorrected {SUV} (0.83), tumor-to-liver ratios (0.80) and tumor-to-muscle ratios (0.79). {SUVs} for chronic pancreatitis, muscle and liver had a tendency to increase with elevated plasma glucose levels.


{CONCLUSION}

Negative {PET} results of patients with elevated plasma glucose should be interpreted with caution.},

The increased glucose metabolism in malignant tumours formed the basis for this investigation, which focused on the role of positron emission tomography ({PET)} with 2[{18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose} ({FDG)} in the detection of pancreatic cancer and its differentiation from chronic pancreatitis. Eighty patients admitted for elective pancreatic surgery received preoperatively 250-350 {mBq} {FDG} intravenously and emission scans were recorded 45 minutes later. Intense focal activity in the pancreatic region was taken at the time of scanning as showing the presence of pancreatic cancer. The presence of cancer was later confirmed by histological examination of the surgical specimens and histological findings were compared with the preoperative {PET} results. Forty one patients with pancreatic cancer (group I: n = 42) had a focally increased {FDG} uptake in the pancreatic region. Two patients with a periampullary carcinoma (group {II:} n = 6) failed to develop {FDG} accumulation. In 28 patients with chronic pancreatitis (group {III:} n = 32) no {FDG} accumulation occurred. Overall sensitivity and specificity of {PET} for malignancy (group I + {II)} were 94\% (45 of 48) and 88\% (28 of 32), respectively. The standard uptake value of the patients with pancreatic carcinoma was significantly higher than in patients with chronic pancreatitis (3.09 (2.18) v 0.87 (0.56); p {\textless} 0.001; median (interquartile range)). These findings show that {FDG-PET} represents a new and non-invasive diagnostic procedure for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and to differentiate pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis.

	abstract = {{UNLABELLED}

The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of [{18F]2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose} ({FDG)} positron emission tomography ({PET)} in patients with a pancreatic mass by comparing the results with those of X-ray computed tomography ({CT)} and magnetic resonance ({MR)} imaging.


{METHODS}

Eighty-six patients with pancreatic lesions, included 65 malignant tumors and 21 benign masses (55 masses were proven histologically and the others were diagnosed clinically), were studied. The diagnostic factors of {CT} and {MR} imaging were evaluated, and those of {FDG} {PET} were also evaluated for malignant and benign masses by visual interpretation and quantitative interpretation with the standardized uptake value ({SUV)} and {SUVgluc} which was designed to reduce the effects of a high blood sugar level. Visual interpretations were evaluated only in {FDG} {PET} images, and quantitative interpretations were evaluated by referring to {CT} and/or {MR} imaging. The correlation between {SUV} and the degree of histological differentiation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma was investigated.


{RESULTS}

Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value ({PPV)}, negative predictive value ({NPV)} and accuracy for {CT} imaging were 91, 62, 88, 68 and 84\%, and for {MR} imaging 78, 70, 88, 54 and 76\%, respectively. In visual interpretation of {FDG} {PET} images, the sensitivity, specificity, {PPV}, {NPV} and accuracy were 82, 81, 93, 59 and 81\%, respectively. Significant differences between malignant and benign lesions existed in {SUV} and {SUVgluc} (p {\textless} 0.0001, each). With the cutoff value of {SUV} as 2.1 and {SUVgluc} as 2.2, the accuracy of diagnosis was maximal. With that cutoff value, the sensitivity, specificity, {PPV}, {NPV} and accuracy for {SUV} were 89, 76, 92, 70 and 86\%, and for {SUVgluc} 91, 76, 92, 73 and 87\%, respectively. The sensitivity and {NPV} of {SUVgluc} were higher than those of {SUV}, which suggests that {SUVgluc} may be more useful in reducing the number of overlooked malignant tumors. The specificity and {PPV} of {FDG} {PET} were superior to those of {CT} and {MR} imaging. There were no significant differences between the {SUVs} of moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas and those of well differentiated adenocarcinomas.


{CONCLUSION}

To improve the diagnostic procedure for classifying masses, {FDG} {PET} with not only {SUV} but also {SUV} corrected by the blood sugar level is required in addition to morphological diagnosis by {CT} and/or {MR} imaging.},

	abstract = {Background The optimal approach for detecting small pancreatic tumors is uncertain. We compared multidetector {CT} ({MDCT)} with follow-up endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS)} without or with fine-needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} for diagnosing pancreatic cancer. Methods Patients with suspicion of pancreatic cancer who underwent dual-phase {MDCT} and follow-up {EUS} were retrospectively reviewed. This consisted of scoring {MDCT} scans independently by three radiologists on a 1–5 scale of certainty, determining whether a stent was present, scoring {EUS} reports regarding presence of a mass and analyzing {EUS-FNA} results. Results A total of 117 patients underwent {MDCT} and {EUS.} {ROC} values for {MDCT} were 0.85, 0.87, and 0.91. There was no significant difference in the accuracy of {EUS} and {MDCT.} Follow-up {EUS} (99\%) was significantly more sensitive than {MDCT} (89\% and 93\%), as interpreted by two radiologists. Follow-up {EUS} was statistically significantly more sensitive than {MDCT} (96\% vs. 70\%) for one radiologist for tumors {\textless} 2 cm. Specificity of {EUS} was 50\%, and sensitivity of {EUS-FNA} was 82\%. Negative predictive value of {EUS-FNA} was significantly less in patients with (21\%) than without (70\%) biliary stents. Conclusions Follow-up {EUS} improves lesion detection over {MDCT} alone. Close follow-up/repeat biopsy should be considered if {FNA} is negative, but {EUS} is positive.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} The clinical data and {CT} studies of 12 patients with pathologically proven {ASqC} of the pancreas between the dates February 2001 and February 2010 were retrospectively analyzed.
{RESULTS:} The presenting symptoms of {ASqC} of the pancreas were nonspecific. Elevated serum levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 12-5, and carcinoembryonic antigen were noted. The tumor was most commonly involved in the pancreatic head in 6 patients, with the dilation of the common bile duct and the upstream main pancreatic duct. All {ASqCs} exhibited invasive growth. No calcification and intratumoral hemorrhage were noted in {ASqCs.} Ten tumors showed enhancement in the early arterial phase and persistent enhancement in the portal vein phase.
{CONCLUSION:} The typical {CT} appearance of {ASqC} was solitary oval or round without any capsule and a defined margin. The dilation of the main pancreatic duct and/or the common bile duct was always discovered. The huge infiltrative lesion outside the pancreas was detected in the tail and/or the body of the pancreas. Not only the elevation of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 is common, but also Ca12-5 and {CEA}, whereas human alpha fetoprotein elevation is not observed.

{METHODS:} Sixty-one patients suspected pancreatic disease underwent low-dose whole pancreas {CT} perfusion scan (by body weight, group A: 70 {kV}, 120 {mAs;} group B: 80 {kV}, 100 {mAs)} and the individualized pancreas scan. Forty-six patients were enrolled. Perfusion characteristics, such as, blood flow, blood volume and permeability, were analyzed. The effective radiation dose of the whole pancreas {CT} perfusion and the total {CT} scan protocol were recorded. {CT} findings were histologically confirmed by surgical intervention or diagnostic puncture.
{RESULTS:} Of the 46 cases, 33 were pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 5 were solid-pseudo-papillary tumors of pancreas, 8 cases of pancreatic endocrine tumors on the perfusion study. There was significant interobserver agreement on the measurement of normal pancreatic {CT} perfusion parameters of group A (n = 28)and group B (n = 18), respectively (p {\textgreater} 0.05). For the normal pancreas, there was no significant difference on {CT} perfusion parameters between group A and group B (p {\textgreater} 0.05). There were significant differences on blood flow as well as blood volume between the pancreatic adenocarcinomas and the normal pancreas (p {\textless} 0.001), whereas no difference on the permeability (p {\textgreater} 0.05). The time to peak of the normal pancreas is 28.94 ± 4.37 s (range from 24 to 38 s). Different pancreatic tumors had different types of time attenuation curve ({TAC).} {TACs} were different between pancreatic adenocarcinomas and normal pancreas. The effective radiation dose of the whole pancreas {CT} perfusion of Group A and Group B were 3.60 and 4.88 {mSv} ({DLP} 246 and 325 {mGy} cm), respectively, and the total radiation dose was around 8.01-16.22 {mSv.}

Установлено, что наиболее информативным методом дифференциальной диагностики является трепанобиопсия под ультразвуковым контролем с гистологической оценкой биоптата. Для окончательного решения объема оперативного вмешательства на поджелудочной железе при хроническом панкреатите и раке поджелудочной железы выполняется интраоперационное ультразвуковое исследование. Проведение чрескожной тонкоигольной биопсии поджелудочной железы под ультразвуковым контролем не должно рассматриваться как окончательная диагностика рака поджелудочной железы., The results of invasive ultrasound investigations in 91 patients with chronic pancreatitis and cancer of the pancreas are presented. It has been estimated that the most informative method of the differential diagnostics is trepan biopsy under ultrasound control with the histological estimation. To make the ultimate decision concerning the volume of surgical procedures on the pancreas in chronic pancreatitis and cancer of the pancreas, one performs intra-operative ultrasound investigation. Application of transcutaneous fine needle biopsy of the pancreas under ultrasound control shouldn't be considered as the ultimate diagnostics of cancer of the pancreas.},

Хроническое воспаление поджелудочной железы (ПЖ) является неоспоримым фактором риска развития РПЖ. Риск развития РПЖ у больных с ХП в 16,5 раза превышает аналогичный показатель общей популяции. Медиаторы воспаления при ХП могут вызывать точечные мутации в генах-супрессорах опухолевого роста и протоонкогенах, что запускает онкогенез в ПЖ. Выделение пациентов с ХП как группы риска развития РПЖ позволит выявлять РПЖ на ранних стадиях и существенно улучшить отдаленные результаты лечения. Перспективным направлением современной онкопанкреатологии является поиск высокоспецифичных и высокочувствительных маркеров генных мутаций, что позволит диагностировать РПЖ на доинвазивной стадии.},

The inheritance of {FPC} is mostly autosomal dominant and with a heterogeneous phenotype. The major gene defect is yet to be identified, although germline mutations in {BRCA2}, {PALB2} and {ATM} are causative in some {FPC} families. Expert consensus conferences considered it appropriate to screen for pancreatic cancer in high-risk individuals using a multidisciplinary approach under research protocol conditions. However, neither biomarkers nor reliable imaging modalities for the detection of high-grade precursor lesions are yet available. Most screening programmes are currently based on findings from endoscopic ultrasonography and {MRI}, and data has demonstrated that precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer can be identified. No consensus exists regarding the age to initiate or stop screening and the optimal intervals for follow-up. Timing and extent of surgery as a treatment for {FPC} are debated. This Review focuses on the clinical phenotype of {FPC}, its histopathological characteristics, known underlying genetic changes and associated genetic counselling and screening.},

{METHODS:} We reviewed the {CT} features, clinical presentations, and clinical outcomes of 15 patients (9 men, 6 women, mean age 62.3) with pathology-proven pancreatic {ACCs.} An abdominal radiologist retrospectively evaluated each patient's initial imaging study with respect to the lesion's size, location, attenuation (Hounsfield units) on arterial and venous phase images, peripancreatic lymphadenopathy, and distant metastases. Additional parameters studied included biliary and pancreatic ductal dilatation, intratumoral hemorrhage, calcification, the presence of cystic/necrotic components, and whether the tumor was intraparenchymal or exophytic.
{RESULTS:} The {ACCs} in this series were evenly distributed between the head/uncinate and the tail, were predominantly exophytic (73\%), tended to be large (average size 5.1 cm), and were mostly hypodense to the surrounding pancreas on both the arterial and venous phase images. A sizeable proportion demonstrated a cystic or necrotic component (53\%) and/or an enhancing capsule (53\%). Of those lesions in the head or uncinate process, very few resulted in pancreatic (28\%) or biliary (14\%) ductal dilatation. None of the lesions in this series showed internal calcification or intratumoral hemorrhage.
{CONCLUSION:} While a prospective diagnosis is difficult, {ACCs} have several features which can differentiate them from ductal adenocarcinoma, including their large size, lack of biliary or pancreatic ductal dilatation, exophytic nature, and the presence of an enhancing capsule.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Several factors contribute to the high mortality of pancreatic cancer, including limitations of diagnostic imaging.
{AIM:} To perform a meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of Fluro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography compared with computed tomography alone.
{METHODS:} Articles were identified through a {MEDLINE} search and bibliography review. Summary estimates and receiver operating curves were calculated using Meta-Test 0.6. Publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed with a funnel plot and chi-squared test.
{RESULTS:} The summary estimate and 95\% confidence interval for sensitivity and specificity were as follows: computed tomography 81\% (72-88\%) and 66\% (53-77\%), {PET} after a positive computed tomography 92\% (87-95\%) and 68\% (51-81\%), {PET} after a negative computed tomography 73\% (50-88\%) and 86\% (75-93\%) and {PET} after an indeterminate computed tomography 100 and 68\%. The area under the summary receiver operating curve was 0.82 for computed tomography and 0.94 for {PET.} There was no heterogeneity or publication bias.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Our results suggest that although adding Fluro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography to the diagnostic work-up may enhance the diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy, its usefulness will vary depending upon the pretest probability of the patient, the results of computed tomography and the provider's testing thresholds. Further evaluation using a well-designed prospective study with a cost-effectiveness analysis is needed to clarify the appropriate role of Fluro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} To develop a technique of projectional computed tomographic ({CT)} cholangiopancreatography ({CTCP).}
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Sixty-one patients underwent {CT} for suspected biliary or pancreatic abnormalities. The axial {CT} and {CTCP} techniques included spiral scanning during the portal venous phase and thick-slab minimum intensity projections. Visualization of pancreatic and extrahepatic bile ducts (divided in five duct segments per patient) was graded blindly on a scale of 1-5 by a consensus of two radiologists. Two hundred seventy-seven duct segments were used to compare axial {CT} and {CTCP} in the depiction of duct segments and dilatation; 109 segments were used to compare {CTCP} with {ERCP.}
{RESULTS:} Fifty-six of 277 duct segments were not visualized on axial {CT} images; 15 segments were not visualized on {CTCP} images (P {\textless} .001). There was no statistically significant difference between the number of segments missed with {ERCP} and the number missed with {CTCP:} nine and three of 109 segments, respectively. Duct visualization was equal on axial {CT} and {CTCP} images in 35 of 109 duct segments and was superior on {CTCP} images in all but one of the remaining segments (P {\textless} .001). Duct visualization on {CTCP} images was equal to that on {ERCP} images in 35 segments, superior in nine, and significantly inferior in 66 (P {\textless} .001).
{CONCLUSION:} {CTCP} improves {CT} depiction of pancreatic and bile ducts with a quality that approaches that of {ERCP.}},

Улучшение результатов хирургического лечения рака поджелудочной железы возможно на основе применения КТ и МРТ с болюсным контрастированием. Наш опыт обследования пациентов с опухолями поджелудочной железы основан на использовании 16-срезового мультиспирального компьютерного томографа и магнитно-резонансного томографа 1,5 Тл. Признаками опухоли поджелудочной железы являются гиповаскулярный очаг в паренхиме, расширение дистальных отделов панкреатического протока с его "обрывом", симптом двух протоков, уменьшение объема парапанкреатической клетчатки, атрофия дистальных отделов железы. Таким образом, использования мультиспиральной КТ и МРТ с болюсным контрастированием не только повышает выявляемость рака поджелудочной железы, но и позволяет оценить резектабельность процесса.},

В 78 (73,6\%) наблюдениях выполнена расширенная ГПДР с резекцией мезентерико-портального венозного сегмента по разработанной методике, в 19 (17,9\%) - расширенная ГПДР в традиционном варианте, в 7 (6,6\%) - экономная ПДР и в 2 (1,9\%) - стандартная ГПДР. Схема комплексного лечения в I периоде исследования включала радикальную операцию и химиотерапию в адъювантом режиме. Во {II} периоде исследования у 16 (45,7\%) пациентов дополнительно проведена предоперационная лучевая терапия в режиме динамического фракционирования СОД 44-50 Гр. Распространенность опухолевого процесса гистологически подтверждена в большинстве наблюдений.

В исследование были включены 19 пациентов, проходивших обследование в Клинической больнице им С.Р. Миротворцева СГМУ г.Саратова с подозрением на опухоль поджелудочной железы. Среди них 8 женщин в возрасте от 27 до 72 лет (средний возраст – 55,9 года.); 11 мужчин от 40 до 75 лет (средний возраст – 60 лет). Всем обследованным выполнялось УЗИ, 15(79\%) – МРТ.Результаты. У 9(47\%) пациентов верифицирован РПЖ,  у 10(53\%) – псевдотуморозный панкреатит. Анализ данных УЗИ показал, что при РПЖ в 4(50\%) случаях обнаружены гипоэхогенные образования (20-51 мм) с неровными контурами. У 5(56\%)  пациентов контуры образований нечеткие. У 7(78\%) обследованных выявлено повышение эхогенности железы, в 2(22\%) случаях Вирсунгов проток расширен (6мм, 9 мм). При псевдотуморозном панкреатите в 3(30\%) случаях обнаружены гипоэхогенные образования (24-52 мм), у 5(50\%) пациентов контуры их неровные и нечеткие. У 7(70\%) обследованных выявлено повышение эхогенности железы, в 2(20\%) случаях Вирсунгов проток расширен (3мм).При МРТ при РПЖ увеличение и неоднородность структуры пораженной части железы наблюдались в 5(62\%) случаях, неровность и нечеткость контуров включений – в 6(75\%) случаях. Интенсивность МР-сигнала неоднородно снижена на Т2 ВИ у 4(50\%) пациентов и Т1 ВИ у 6(75\%). У 6(75\%) обследованных выявлено расширение главного панкреатического протока, у 3(37\%) – обрыв и извитая форма. При псевдотуморозном панкреатите во всех случаях отмечена диффузная неоднородность железы. Интенсивность МР-сигнала неоднородно повышена на Т2 ВИ у всех пациентов и неоднородно снижена на Т1 ВИ у 4(80\%). При исследовании с динамическим контрастным усилением отмечено повышение МР-сигнала от патологической зоны при РПЖ на постконтрастных томограммах. При псевдотуморозном панкреатите степень контрастирования поджелудочной железы равномерна.Выводы.1.УЗИ - наиболее доступный и безопасный метод обследования поджелудочной железы, но в дифференциальной диагностике РПЖ и псевдотуморозного панкреатита оно малоинформативно.2. В дифференциальной диагностике РПЖ и псевдотуморозного панкреатита большое значение имеет МРТ, а информативность исследования с динамическим контрастным усилением приближается к 100\%.},

Резидуальные камни желчных протоков - одно из основных «осложнений» после холецистэктомии и главная причина выпол­нения повторных операций на билиарной системе. Неудовлет­ворительные результаты оперативного лечения обусловлены наличием сопутствующей патологии, функциональных изменений со стороны печени у больных пожилого возраста, спаечным процессом у пациентов, оперируемых повторно, и осложнениями холедохолитиаза (механичес­кая желтуха, холангит).     Подвергнуто анализу 124 больных, которым производилось ЭРПХГ и ЭПСТ на базе кафедры госпитальной хирургии лечебного за 2008 - 2012 г. Мужчин было 38\%, женщин 62\%. По возрастным группам больные старше 60 лет составили более 65\%, отягощенные сопутствующей патологией и высокой степенью операционного риска.        Всем больным исследование проводилось в первые 48 часов с момента госпитализации. ЭРПХГ позволила выявить следующие причины механической желтухи: холедохолитиаз у 36\% больных, холедохолитиаз в сочетании со стенозом БДС у 5,4\% больных, рак внутри- и внепеченочных желчных протоков у 1,2\% больных, доброкачественные и злокачественные опухоли БДС у 7,4\% больных, рак поджелудочной железы у 7\% больных.        У 13\% больных при ЭРПХГ патологии со стороны гепатопанкреатодуоденальной области не выявлено, то есть желтуха носила паренхиматозный характер, что так же определило дальнейшую тактику обследования и лечения.        Непосредственно после ЭПСТ при холедохолитиазе в 15\% случаях отмечено отхождение конкрементов в просвет кишки, в 14\% случаях произведена холедохолитоэкстракция крупных конкрементов корзинкой Дормиа, в остальных случаях камни самостоятельно мигрировали в двенадцатиперстную кишку через 2-5 суток. Неудачные попытки удаления конкрементов отмечались у 4\% больных при фиксированных камнях в ретропанкреатической и супрадуоденальной части холедоха.        Выводы.ЭРПХГ позволяет в ранние сроки заболевания провести дифференциальную диагностику механической желтухи, установить ее причину, степень выраженности воспалительных изменений, а также определить тактику и выбор объема оперативного вмешательства.},

	abstract = {Цель исследования - изучить различия в экспрессии молекулярно-биологических маркеров при аденокарциномах ПЖЖ различной локализации. Иммуногистохимическим методом на парафиновых блоках, полученных от 53 больных, изучали экспрессию 7 молекулярно-биологических маркеров. Для аденокарциномы головки ПЖЖ характерна высокая экспрессия в опухолевых клетках ангиогенных факторов ТФ (77,3 \%) и {VEGF} (59,1 \%), тогда как для аденокарцином, локализованных в теле и хвосте ПЖЖ, характерна высокая пролиферативная активность опухоли (52,6 \%), высокая частота экспрессии ЦОГ-2 (68,4 \%) и ТФ (57,9 \%). Среди молекулярно-биологических маркеров только экспрессия Bcl-2 показала прогностическую значимость. Ни один из Bcl-2“ больных не прожил более 1 года, тогда как среди Bcl-2+ пациентов таких больных оказалось 50 \%. Медиана общей выживаемости для Bcl-2 - больных составила 5±2 мес., а для Bcl-2+ - 12±4 мес. (р=0,069). Дальнейшие исследования по оценки роли молекулярно-биологических маркеров у больных раком ПЖЖ являются перспективными для оптимизации тактики лечения пациентов и выбора рациональной терапии.},

	abstract = {В статье представлен первый в России опыт диагностики и лечения аутоиммунного панкреатита, а также литературные данные об этой патологии. Проведен ретроспективный анализ патогистологических препаратов и историй болезни 46 пациентов, перенесших панкреатодуоденальную резекцию в период с 1994 по 2007 гг. по поводу рака поджелудочной железы, который не был подтвержден при плановом гистологическом исследовании. На основании строгих морфологических критериев в 37 случаях были выявлены признаки хронического калькулезного, а в 9 случаях - аутоиммунного панкреатита. В одном наблюдении диагноз «аутоиммунный панкреатит» установлен на основании радиологических и серологических критериев, а эффективная стероидная терапия подтвердила его. Изучены демографические, клинические и радиологические признаки аутоиммунного панкреатита, а также ближайшие и отдаленные результаты оперативного и консервативного лечения. Анализ полученных данных показал, что аутоиммунный панкреатит имеет определенную клинико-инструментальную картину, позволяющую заподозрить это заболевание после КТ или МРТ. Однако относительная редкость заболевания и недостаток информации о его проявлениях ограничивает возможности выявления как диффузных, так и локальных форм заболевания, а следовательно, их адекватного лечения., The article presents the first in Russia experience of diagnostics and treatment of autoimmune pancreatitis and also some literature data about this pathology. The retrospective analysis of pathohistological preparations is carried out as well as of the case histories of 46 patients, who underwent during the period from 1994 till 2007 the pancreatoduodenal resection because of the pancreas cancer, which wasn't confirmed at routine histological examination. In 37 cases the signs of chronic calculous and in 9 cases - of autoimmune pancreatitis were revealed on the basis of strict morphological criteria. In one observation the diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis was made on the basis of radiological and serologic criteria and it was also confirmed by an effective steroid therapy. Demographic, clinical and radiological features of autoimmune pancreatitis were studied as well as the immediate and distant results of the operative and conservative treatment. The analysis of the obtained data has displayed that autoimmune pancreatitis has a certain clinical-instrumental manifestation that permits to suspect this disease after {CT} and {MRT.} However, comparative rarity of this disease and insufficient information about its manifestation limit the revelation possibilities of both diffusive and local forms of the disease and their adequate treatment consequently.},

	abstract = {Метастатическое поражение головного мозга (МГМ) - распространенное проявление системного онкологического процесса, соответствующее 4-й стадии болезни, что само по себе связано с плохим прогнозом. Неврологические симптомы МГМ оказывают существенное негативное влияние на качество жизни больного, а средняя продолжительность жизни после выявления метастазов в головном мозге не превышает 8 мес. Пациенты обычно погибают от внутричерепных осложнений или проявлений системного онкологического процесса. Данные литературы свидетельствуют о повышении частоты встречаемости МГМ, что является следствием более широкого применения современных методов визуализации - магнитнорезонансной томографии (МРТ) головного мозга, а также увеличения сроков выживаемости при многих злокачественных новообразованиях. Среди множества злокачественных опухолей, наиболее часто метастазирующих в головной мозг, выделяют рак легкого (16-20\%), меланому (7-8\%), рак почки (6-9\%), молочной железы (5-6\%) и колоректальный рак (1-2 \%). Рак поджелудочной железы (ПЖ) - опухоль с крайне неблагоприятным прогнозом. Для карцином ПЖ характерно, прежде всего, метастазирование в регионарные лимфатические узлы, а также лимфатические коллекторы вокруг чревного ствола и аорты. Гематогенные метастазы чаще всего выявляются в печени (до 80\%), брюшине (50\%), легких (17\%), реже в мышцах, почке, коже, сердце, плевре, желудке, пупке, аппендиксе и предстательной железе. Метастазы рака ПЖ в головном мозге встречаются крайне редко. По данным литературы, начиная с 1978 года, описано всего 18 случаев рака ПЖ с МГМ. В связи с редкостью МГМ при раке ПЖ приводим наше наблюдение протоковой аденокарциномы ПЖ с метастазом в стволе головного мозга у пациентки 66 лет.},

Интраоперационная диагностика (УЗИ, тонкоигольная аспирационная и эксцизионная биопсия) позволяет поставить правильный диагноз лишь в половине наблюдений. Больные нефункционирующими нейроэндокринными опухолями поджелудочной железы подлежат оперативному лечению, поскольку более чем у половины из них в опухоли выявлены признаки малигнизации. Большие размеры опухолей не являются противопоказанием к операции. В большинстве наблюдений тактика при НЭО должна быть такой же, как при раке ПЖ. Иссечение опухоли допустимо только при размере до 2 см и доброкачественности, подтвержденной гистологически.},

	issn = {0042-4625},
	abstract = {Опухоли органов билиопан-креатодуоденальной зоны (БПДЗ) составляют 15\% от всех злокачественных новообразований желудочно-кишечного тракта и имеют тенденцию к увеличению [3-5]. Следует подчеркнуть, что на высокие показатели заболеваемости раком поджелудочной железы (ПЖ) в индустриально развитых странах влияет уровень прижизненной выявляемости опухолей с помощью современных методов диагностики [1, 8, 10]. С другой стороны, раннее выявление опухолей БПДЗ является одним из наиболее сложных вопросов лучевой диагностики. Правильная оценка всех проявлений того или иного патологического процесса обусловливает выбор тактики лечения и влияет на непосредственные и отдаленные результаты. На сегодняшний день единственным методом потенциально радикального лечения злокачественных опухолей БПДЗ остается хирургический: прогноз течения заболевания у пациентов с выявленными на ранних этапах опухолями поджелудочной железы и подвергшихся радикальному хирургическому лечению всегда значительно лучше, при этом операбельность, по разным данным, не превышает 15-17\% [2]. Операбельность определяется, главным образом, отношением опухоли к расположенным рядом магистральным сосудам, следовательно, на этапе обследования и выработки тактики лечения принципиальное значение имеет информация, позволяющая судить о взаимоотношении опухоли с прилежащими органами и магистральными сосудами: аортой, чревным стволом, селезеночной и верхней брыжеечной артериями, верхней брыжеечной и воротной венами [1]. Традиционно ангиография, компьютерная томография (КТ) и эксплоративная лапаротомия были первичными методами оценки резектабель-ности у пациентов. Более новые диагностические методики, такие как тонкослойная спиральная КТ с высоким разрешением, магнитно-резонансная томография (МРТ), эндоскопическое УЗИ и лапароскопия позволяют повысить точность диагностики и предоперационного стадирования рака ПЖ. Несмотря на это, остается значительной подгруппа пациентов, у которых опухоль по результатам методов визуализации выглядит резектабельной, однако при эксплоративной лапаротомии уже имеет признаки местного распространения или метастазы. Постоянно совершенствующаяся техника оперативного лечения позволяет выполнять высокотехнологичные вмешательства, в том числе с сосудистой пластикой, но такие операции требуют особого планирования и сложны для выполнения [6]. В то же время без максимально возможной эрадикации опухолевой ткани и полноценной санации забрюшинных лимфатических коллекторов трудно рассчитывать на достижение ремиссии заболевания. Выявление пациентов с нерезектабельными опухолями должно понизить долю диагностических лапаротомий и необоснованно завышенных по объему вмешательств. Избегая лапаротомии, в ряде случаев можно не откладывать начало паллиативной терапии, задержка которой вызвана восстановительным послеоперационным периодом. Эффективные методы предоперационного стадирования помогают также выбрать подходящих кандидатов для агрессивной неоадъювантной лучевой и химиотерапии [7, 9, 11].},

The technique was performed in 42 patients with cancer of the pancreas and 8 patients with nodular fibrosis of chronic pancreatitis. The lesions were clearly identified in all 50 patients, even when the size of the tumor was less than 20 mm in diameter. A tumor of the pancreas was usually visualized as a hypoechoic mass that had a characteristic image depending on the size. Ultrasonographic differentiation of malignant from benign tumors of the pancreas was possible in tumors larger than 30 mm in size but difficult in tumors less than 20 mm in size. Compared with conventional ultrasonography, endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, computed tomography, and angiography, endoscopic ultrasonography had the highest detection rate of tumors of the pancreas, especially in cases of small tumors under 20 mm in size. In cancer of the pancreas, endoscopic ultrasonography also proved to be valuable for the detection of vascular invasion.},

	abstract = {{Background/Purpose} The microvessel density ({MVD)} of most malignant tumors is considered to be strongly related to metastasis and prognosis. Weidner’s “hot spot method” for determining {MVD} is in general use, but it is possible that cells other than endothelial cells will also be stained. In our previous study, no correlations were observed between {MVD} determined by the “hot spot method” and prognosis/metastasis. But, using the “lumen method,” we found a correlation with the number of vessel structures only. In the present study, we analyzed the staining of microvessels in pancreatic cancer, using light microscopy, confocal laser scan microscopy ({CLSM)}, and transmission electron microscopy ({TEM).} Methods Microvessel staining of pancreatic cancer with {CD34}, factor {VIII}, and {CD45} antibodies was examined in consecutive slices by light microscopy. For {CLSM}, freshly resected specimens were immunostained with factor {VIII} and fluorescein isothiocynate. For {TEM}, specimens were fixed with 2.5\% glutaraldehyde, treated with 1\% osmium tetroxide, and embedded in epoxy resin. Results Staining of vessels with {CD34} and factor {VIII} antibodies appeared similar under light microscopy. However, {CD34-stained} consecutive slices were judged not to reveal vessel structures, and some cells stained with {CD45} antibody were similar in appearance to {CD34-stained} cells. Under {CLSM}, irregular arrangements of neovascularization, consisting of many branches, were observed, but many positively stained cells not identified as vessels were also seen. Microvessels were distinctly identified under {TEM}, but the types of individual cells could not be determined. Conclusions An integrated, reproducible method for the measurement of {MVD} is vital. For pancreatic cancer, the “lumen method” is recommended.},

{METHODOLOGY:} {CD34} expression was analyzed using immunohistochemical methods. Mean {MVC} in 5 areas per specimen and clinicopathological factors were consecutively examined in 42 {PC} patients.
{RESULTS:} Median {MVC} for {PC} patients was 123/mm2, which was applied as a cut-off value. Higher {MVC} was significantly associated with the advanced Japanese tumor-node-metastasis stage {IVa} and {IVb} (p=0.034). Univariate survival analysis identified higher carcinoembryonic antigen ({CEA)} and {CA19-9} level, infiltrative type on macroscopic examination, invasive ductal carcinoma, node metastasis and higher tumor-node-metastasis classification were significantly associated with poor survival. The 5-year overall survival rate in the higher {MVC} group tended to be lower than that in the higher {MVC} group (37 vs. 55\%), but not statistically significant (p=0.15).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Tumor {MVC} might be a candidate prognostic marker of {PC} patient survival after pancreatectomy and further investigation in a larger series is warranted to clarify the significance of this marker.},

{METHODS:} From October 2007 to September 2009, 83 patients who had undergone both {DWI} and {MDCT} with {MPD} dilatation were identified and were reviewed by four readers (2 radiologists and 2 gastroenterology fellows). Diagnostic performance in pancreatic cancer detection was evaluated with 95\% confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences in the detection of pancreatic cancer between {DWI} and {MDCT} were compared by receiver operating characteristics and the confidence of the diagnosis by the paired t test.
{RESULTS:} Thirty-two of 83 patients were diagnosed with primary pancreatic cancer by histological evaluation of 15 surgical and 2 endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration samples, and by the clinical course for 15 lesions. Overall average accuracies of pancreatic cancer detection by the four readers were 84\% with {DWI} and 86\% with {MDCT.}
{CONCLUSION:} Performance of {DWI} and {MDCT} was equivocal for detection of pancreatic cancer in a high-risk population with {MPD} dilatation. The combination of {MRCP} and {DWI} for detection of pancreatic cancer allowed identification of a high-risk population and tumor detection with a single imaging modality with no need for contrast medium.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} We included 14 patients (4 men and 10 women; mean age, 64.5 years) with diffuse pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma on the basis of retrospective radiological review. Two radiologists retrospectively reviewed 14 {CT} scans in consensus with respect to the following: tumor site, peripheral capsule-like structure, dilatation of intratumoral pancreatic duct, parenchymal atrophy, and ancillary findings. Eight magnetic resonance ({MR)} examinations with {MR} cholangiopancreatography ({MRCP)} and seven endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ({ERCP)} were also reviewed, focusing on peripheral capsule-like structure and dilatation of intratumoral pancreatic duct.
{RESULTS:} {CT} revealed tumor localization to the body and tail in 11 (79\%) patients and peripheral capsule-like structure in 13 (93\%). The intratumoral pancreatic duct was not visible in 13 (93\%). Pancreatic parenchymal atrophy was not present in all 14 patients. Tumor invasion of vessels was observed in all 14 patients and of neighbor organs in 8 (57\%).

Computed tomography ({CT)} is the workhorse of oncology, but is poor at defining the nature of pancreatic lesions. Small primary tumors are often not visualized. Fast magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} techniques allowing dynamic imaging after {IV} gadolinium and new contrast agents allow better characterization of the lesions for patients having contraindications for {IV} {CT} contrast agents.

However, there remained considerable overlapping between the {SUVmax} values of both diseases except either at the higher range for pancreatic cancer ({\textgreater} 7.7 at 1 hour or {\textgreater} 9.98 at 2 hours) or at the lower range for mass-forming pancreatitis ({\textless}3.37 at 1 hour or {\textless}3.53 at 2 hours). No obvious difference was found in the {FDG} uptake patterns of the mass areas between both diseases.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Differentiation between metastasis-free pancreatic cancer and mass-forming pancreatitis is difficult by {FDG-PET/CT} due to considerable overlapping between the {SUVmax} values of the two diseases, although the differential diagnosis may be possible either at the higher range of {SUVmax} ({\textgreater} 7.7 at 1 hour or {\textgreater} 9.98 at 2 hours) for pancreatic cancer or at the lower range of {SUVmax} ({\textless}3.37 at 1 hour or {\textless}3.53 at 2 hours) for mass-forming pancreatitis.},

	abstract = {{AIM:} To evaluate the use of three-dimensional imaging of pancreatic carcinoma using multidetector computed tomography ({CT)} in a prospective study.
{METHODS:} Ten patients with suspected pancreatic tumors were examined prospectively using multidetector {CT} (Somatom Sensation 16, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). The images were evaluated for the presence of a pancreatic carcinoma and invasion of the peripancreatic vessels and surrounding organs. Using the isotropic {CT} data sets, a three-dimensional image was created with automatic vascular analysis and semi-automatic segmentation of the organs and pancreatic tumor by a radiologist. The {CT} examinations and the three-dimensional images were presented to the surgeon directly before and during the patient's operation using the Medical Imaging Interaction Toolkit-based software {"ReLiver".} Immediately after surgery, the value of the two images was judged by the surgeon. The operation and the histological results served as the gold standard.
{RESULTS:} Nine patients had a pancreatic carcinoma (all {pT3)}, and one patient had a serous cystadenoma. One tumor infiltrated the superior mesenteric vein. The infiltration was correctly evaluated. All carcinomas were resectable. In comparison to the {CT} image with axial and coronal reconstructions, the three-dimensional image was judged by the surgeons as better for operation planning and consistently described as useful.
{CONCLUSION:} A {3D-image} of the pancreas represents an invaluable aid to the surgeon. However, the {3D-software} must be further developed in order to be integrated into daily clinical routine.},

We evaluated the accuracy and complication rate of {CT} guided biopsies of pancreatic lesions with i.v.-contrast application following needle placement in comparison to biopsy after contrast enhanced {CT.}
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} In 30 patients planning and needle placement was performed on the basis of a native planning {CT} and prior diagnostic {CT} or {MRT.} After needle placement contrast enhanced {CT} was performed to confirm needle course and adjusted if necessary (group 1). In 30 additional patients biopsy was planned based on contrast enhanced {CT} and needle was placed in the lesion. Control scans confirmed correct needle position (group 2). An {18G} coaxial system was used for both groups. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t and Fisher's exact test for comparison of lesion size, location as well as accuracy and complication rates.
{RESULTS:} Mean lesion size was significantly smaller in group 1 (31 mm vs. 39 mm; p = 0.02). Diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity for malignancy in group 1 was 93\% and 92\% versus 80\% and 77\% in group 2. Complications related to the procedure, i.e. haematoma (n = 5, group 1/n = 2, group 2) and pain (n = 0, group 1/n = 2, group 2) did not statistically differ.

{SUBJECTS} {AND} {METHODS:} Seventy-one patients (41 men, 30 women; mean age, 63 years; range, 29-80 years) with suspected pancreatic tumor underwent {MDCT.} Scanning was performed on an {MDCT} scanner with 0.5-sec gantry rotation and acquisition of 4 slices per rotation. Unenhanced scanning was followed by one set of scanning in the caudocranial direction from the inferior hepatic margin to the diaphragm with a scanning delay of 60 sec after the {IV} injection of 150 {mL} of contrast material delivered at 3 {mL/sec.} Two reviewers independently scored images in a blinded fashion for the presence of tumor and assessment of resectability. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed.
{RESULTS:} A final histopathologic diagnosis derived from surgical findings was obtained in 42 patients; in the remaining 29 patients, percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy coupled with a 1-year clinical follow-up to determine development of local, regional or distant neoplasm served as gold standard proof of diagnosis. Final diagnosis was pancreatic cancer in 40 patients (27 ductal adenocarcinoma, nine mucinous cystoadenocarcinoma, two neuroendocrine tumors, one lymphoma, and one papillary cystoadenocarcinoma) and chronic pancreatitis in 31. The mean tumor size was 2.4 cm (range, 4-1 cm). Values for the area under the curve (A(z)) for the assessment of tumor detection were 0.97 for reviewer 1 and 0.96 for reviewer 2 (p = not significant). A(z) values for tumor resectability were 0.90 for reviewer 1 and 0.90 for reviewer 2 (p = not significant). No statistically significant differences were observed between superior mesenteric artery and vein opacification with the hepatic parenchyma enhanced at a time closer to the peak hepatic enhancement, optimizing the detection of hepatic lesions.
{CONCLUSION:} Thin-section single-phase {MDCT} is an accurate technique for the diagnosis and assessment of resectability in patients with a suspected pancreatic neoplasm. This technique provides optimal tumor-to-pancreas contrast and maximal pancreatic parenchymal and peripancreatic vascular enhancement. It allows visualization of the entire liver and the whole upper abdomen during the portal phase for accurate identification of liver metastases and peritoneal seeding.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}

Computed tomography ({CT)} perfusion studies can provide valuable information regarding tumor vascularization. We report on a study assessing {CT} perfusion characteristics in the normal pancreas and in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.


{METHODS}

Twenty healthy subjects and 20 patients with histologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma were included in the study after written informed consent and approval by our institutional review board. All subjects underwent perfusion {CT} imaging of the pancreas using 128-slice dual-source {CT.} The scanning sequence included 18 scans. Parametric maps of blood volume ({BV)}, blood flow ({BF)}, and permeability surface area product ({PS)} were generated and compared with density measurements.


{RESULTS}

In normal pancreas, no significant difference in perfusion values was observed between head, body, and tail of the pancreas. Mean organ values were 76.76 ({SD}, 15.6) {mL/100} g/min, 15.80 ({SD}, 2.40) {mL/100} g, and 27.74 ({SD}, 16.8) {mL/100} g/min for {BF}, {BV}, and {PS}, respectively. Compared with the normal pancreas, a 60\% reduction in {BF} and {BV} was observed in the tumor tissue. Perfusion values gradually increased toward the tumor rim. Necrotic tumor areas were identified in 25\% of patients. No significant differences were observed when comparing normal pancreas and healthy pancreatic tissue in adenocarcinoma patients.


{CONCLUSIONS}

The feasibility of whole-tumor perfusion imaging using 128-slice {CT} was demonstrated in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Perfusion {CT} provides additional information compared with image assessment based on density measurements (Hounsfield units) and allows noninvasive assessment of vascularization in the tumor tissue.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}

Perfusion {CT} is able to outline blood perfusion changes in a tissue. Thus, in lesions of the tissues of the pancreas, this offers to increase the accuracy of {CT} diagnosis. In this study, our aim was to explore the perfusion characteristics of normal pancreas and pancreatic adenocarcinoma.


{METHODS}

Dynamic 64-slice helical {CT} was conducted in 36 patients with non-pancreatic disease and in 40 patients with histopathologically proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Perfusion parameters including blood flow ({BF)}, blood volume ({BV)}, and permeability surface area product ({PS)} were recorded.


{RESULTS}

There was no significant difference noted between the distribution of {BF}, {BV}, and {PS} values in different regions of the pancreas, namely the head, neck, body, and tail (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The {BF}, {BV}, and {PS} of normal pancreas were recorded as 135.24 +/- 48.36 ml min(-1) 100 g(-1), 200.55 +/- 54.96 ml 100 g(-1), and 49.75 +/- 24.27 ml min(-1) 100 g(-1), respectively. {BF}, {BV}, and {PS} values of the tumor tissue of pancreatic adenocarcinoma decreased significantly compared to normal pancreas (P {\textless} 0.05).


{CONCLUSIONS}

Normal pancreas appears homogenous on perfusion {CT.} A significant decrease of {BF}, {BV}, and {PS} was observed in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Dynamic 64-slice helical {CT} with perfusion imaging should be considered a potential modality to increase the accuracy of {CT} diagnosis for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.},

{METHODS:} An anthropomorphic pancreas phantom with 16 small lesions was scanned using 4 kinds of {CT} scanners with different tube current-time products (75-250 {mAs).} The {CT} images were reconstructed using filtered back projection ({FBP)} and the relevant {IR} of each vendor ({GE} Healthcare, Philips Healthcare, Siemens Healthcare, Toshiba Medical Systems). The image qualities, dose reduction rate (in percent), and figure of merit ({FOM)} were evaluated in comparison with the reference images (250 {mAs}, {FBP).}
{RESULTS:} Image noise was markedly improved with the {IR;} therefore, a 36 to 60\% dose reduction was possible. As a result, the final {CT} dose index volume can be diminished to 7.05 to 11.40 {mGy} with the {IR} algorithms. The {IR} demonstrated 1.52 to 7.84 times higher {FOM} than that of {FBP.} Particularly, an advanced fully {IR} showed outstanding results of {FOM} (6.06-7.84 times).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Because {IR} can reduce image noise while maintaining image quality for the delineation of small pancreatic lesions, it can be used for pancreatic imaging with substantial radiation dose reduction.},

{METHODOLOGY:} The radiological features of 36 {AIP} patients and 36 patients with resected {PC} diagnosed at Samsung Medical Center from January 1991 to October 2010, were compared.
{RESULTS:} Regarding {CT/MRI} findings, diffuse pancreas enlargement, capsule-like rim and delayed homogenous enhancement, were significantly more frequent in {AIP.} For cholangiopancreatography findings, main pancreatic duct ({MPD)} narrowing by ≥1/3 of the pancreatic length, skipped lesions of the {MPD}, the presence of side branches at the narrowed {MPD} portion, and smooth and straight intrapancreatic common bile duct stenosis were significantly more frequent in {AIP.} However, according to {FDG-PET} findings, {SUVmax}, uptake shape and pattern, and uptake by extrapancreatic lesions were not significantly different for {AIP} and {PC.}
{CONCLUSIONS:} Diffuse pancreas enlargement, a capsule-like rim, delayed homogenous enhancement, {MPD} narrowing of ≥1/3 of the pancreatic length, skipped lesions and the presence of side branches at the narrow {MPD} portion were found to have high specificity for {AIP.} These findings have great power to differentiate {AIP} and {PC.}},

	abstract = {This study aimed to assess the role of a quantitative dynamic {PET} model in pancreatic cancer as a potential index of tumor aggressiveness and predictor of survival.
{METHODS:} Seventy-one patients with ({18)F-FDG-avid} adenocarcinoma of the pancreas before treatment were recruited, including 27 with localized tumors (11 underwent pancreatectomy, and 16 had localized nonresectable tumors) and 44 with metastatic disease. Dynamic ({18)F-FDG} {PET} images were acquired over a 60-min period, followed by a whole-body {PET/CT} study. Quantitative data measurements were based on a 2-compartment model, and the following variables were calculated: {VB} (fractional blood volume in target area), K(1) and k(2) (kinetic membrane transport parameters), k(3) and k(4) (intracellular ({18)F-FDG} phosphorylation and dephosphorylation parameters, respectively), and ({18)F-FDG} {INF} (global ({18)F-FDG} influx).
{RESULTS:} The single significant variable for overall survival ({OS)} in patients with localized disease was ({18)F-FDG} {INF.} Patients with a high ({18)F-FDG} {INF} ({\textgreater}0.033 min(-1)) had a median {OS} of 6 and 5 mo for nonresectable and resected tumors, respectively, versus 15 and 19 mo for a low ({18)F-FDG} {INF} in nonresectable and resected tumors, respectively (P {\textless} 0.04). In metastatic disease, multivariate analysis found {VB}, K(1), and k(3) to be significant variables for {OS} (P {\textless} 0.043, {\textless}0.031, and {\textless}0.009, respectively). Prognostic factors for {OS} in the entire group of patients that were significant at multivariate analysis were stage of disease, {VB}, K(1), and ({18)F-FDG} {INF} (P {\textless} 0.00035, {\textless}0.03, {\textless}0.024, and {\textless}0.008, respectively). Median {OS} for all patients with a high ({18)F-FDG} {INF}, low {VB}, and high K(1) was 3 mo, as opposed to 14 mo in patients with a low ({18)F-FDG} {INF}, high {VB}, and low K(1) (P {\textless} 0.021), irrespective of stage and resectability.
{CONCLUSION:} Quantitative ({18)F-FDG} kinetic parameters measured by dynamic {PET} in newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer correlated with the aggressiveness of disease. The ({18)F-FDG} {INF} was the single most significant variable for {OS} in patients with localized disease, whether resectable or not.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} This study was approved by the institutional review board and compliant with {HIPAA.} The requirement for informed consent was waived. One hundred sixty-three consecutive patients referred for possible pancreatic mass underwent {CT} with either a standard or split-bolus spectral {CT} protocol depending on scanner availability. Split-bolus spectral {CT} ({CT} unit with spectral imaging) combines pancreatic and portal venous phases in a single scan: 70 seconds before {CT}, 100 {mL} of contrast material is injected for the portal venous phase followed approximately 35 seconds later by injection of 40 {mL} of contrast material to boost the pancreatic phase. Bolus tracking after the second bolus initiates scanning 15 seconds after aorta enhancement reaches 280 {HU.} Images were reconstructed at 60 and 77 {keV.} The standard protocol (64-detector row unit) included unenhanced and pancreatic and portal venous phase imaging, with a single contrast material injection timed with bolus tracking 15 seconds after aortic enhancement of 300 {HU} for the pancreatic phase and 32 seconds later for the portal venous phase. Tumor conspicuity (difference in attenuation between tumor and pancreatic parenchyma) and contrast-to-noise ratio ({CNR)} were determined. Attenuation of aorta, main portal vein, and liver were measured. Patient size and per-examination radiation dose were recorded. The heteroscedastic t test, Fisher exact test, and Mann-Whitney test were used for statistical analysis.
{RESULTS:} There were no significant differences in age, weight, and body mass index between patients in the standard {CT} (46 of 80 patients had lesions) and split-bolus spectral {CT} (39 of 83 patients had lesions) groups; however, there were significantly more women in the split-bolus group (P = .02). Tumor conspicuity and {CNR} were higher with the 60-{keV} split-bolus protocol (89.1 {HU} ± 56.6 and 8.8 ± 6.2, respectively) than with the pancreatic or portal venous phase of the standard protocol (43.5 {HU} ± 28.4 and 4.5 ± 3.0, and 51.5 {HU} ± 30.3 and 5.6 ± 4.0, respectively; P {\textless} .01 for all comparisons). Dose-length product was 1112 {mGy} · cm ± 437 with the standard protocol and 633 {mGy} · cm ± 105 with the split-bolus protocol (P {\textless} .001).
{CONCLUSION:} Split-bolus spectral multidetector {CT} resulted in vascular, liver, and pancreatic attenuation and tumor conspicuity equal to or greater than that with multiphase {CT}, with a 43\% reduction in radiation dose.},

{METHODS:} Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} and triple-phase computed tomography ({CT)} scans of 79 patients (19 with f-{AIP}, 30 with {PC}, and 30 with a normal pancreas) were evaluated retrospectively. A radiologist measured the {CT} attenuation of the pancreatic parenchyma, the f-{AIP} and {PC} lesions in triple phases. The mean {CT} attenuation values of the f-{AIP} lesions were compared with those of {PC}, and the mean {CT} attenuation values of pancreatic parenchyma in the three groups were compared. The diagnostic performance of {CT} attenuation changes from arterial phase to hepatic phase in the differentiation between f-{AIP} and {PC} was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic ({ROC)} curve analysis. We also investigated the incidence of previously reported radiological findings for differentiation between f-{AIP} and {PC.}
{RESULTS:} The mean {CT} attenuation values of f-{AIP} lesions in enhanced phases were significantly higher than those of {PC} (arterial phase: 60 ± 7 vs 48 ± 10, P {\textless} 0.05; pancreatic phase: 85 ± 6 vs 63 ± 15, P {\textless} 0.05; hepatic phase: 95 ± 7 vs 63 ± 13, P {\textless} 0.05). The mean {CT} attenuation values of f-{AIP} lesions were significantly lower those of uninvolved pancreas and normal pancreas in the arterial and pancreatic phase of {CT} (P {\textless} 0.001, P {\textless} 0.001), with no significant difference at the hepatic phase or unenhanced scanning (P = 0.4, P = 0.1). When the attenuation value increase was equal or more than 28 {HU} this was considered diagnostic for f-{AIP}, and a sensitivity of 87.5\%, specificity of 100\% and an area under the {ROC} curve of 0.974 ({95\%CI:} 0.928-1.021) were achieved. Five findings were more frequently observed in f-{AIP} patients: (1) sausage-shaped enlargement; (2) delayed homogeneous enhancement; (3) hypoattenuating capsule-like rim; (4) irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct ({MPD)} and/or stricture of the common bile duct ({CBD);} and (5) {MPD} upstream dilation ≤ 5 mm.
{CONCLUSION:} Analysis of a combination of {CT} and {MRI} findings could improve the diagnostic accuracy of differentiating f-{AIP} from {PC.}},

{METHODS:} We conducted a retrospective review of patients who presented to the Johns Hopkins Multidisciplinary Pancreas Cancer Clinic with a clearly resectable solid pancreas mass, {\textgreater}1 cm in size over a 2-year period (6/2007-6/2009) and underwent resection. Pancreas specialists reviewed patient records and identified an index {CT} with a solid pancreas mass deemed to be resectable for curative intent. Data were collected on all studies and interventions between the index {CT} and the surgery.
{RESULTS:} A total of 101 patients had an index {CT.} Following the index {CT} and before surgery, 78 patients had at least one {CT}, 19 had magnetic resonance imaging, 9 had a positron emission tomography scan, and 66 underwent pancreatic biopsy. Patients underwent a mean of three studies with a mean added cost of \$3,371 per patient. Preoperative tests and interventions were associated with a longer time to definitive surgical intervention.
{CONCLUSION:} Wide variation exists for evaluation of newly discovered resectable solid pancreas masses, which is associated with delays to surgical intervention and added costs.},

{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} {FDG} {PET/CT} findings were reviewed in 8 patients with {SPTP} confirmed by pathology. Early {PET/CT} scans were performed 1 hour after {FDG} injection in all 8 patients. After an interval of 1 hour, delayed {PET/CT} scans were performed in 6 patients. All patients underwent enhanced {CT} and 4 patients underwent {MRI.}
{RESULTS:} A total of 8 tumors were detected in all 8 patients. {CT} and {MRI} findings included encapsulation (n = 2), solid and cystic components (n = 4), focal calcification (n = 7), and weak enhancement during the arterial phase on enhanced {CT} or {MRI} and increasing enhancement during the portal venous phase (n = 8). All the tumors showed increased {FDG} uptake. The mean {SUVmax} of all tumors was 8.9, with a high variability of {SUVmax} among lesions ranging from 2.5 to 29.1. The tumors (n = 6) with high cellularity had stronger {FDG} uptake, whereas the tumors (n = 2) with low cellularity had relatively low {FDG} uptake. The tumors (n = 6) with pancreatic parenchymal, vascular, or perineural invasions had intense {FDG} uptake, whereas the tumors (n = 2) without invasions had slight-to-moderate {FDG} uptake. Two tumors with relatively high proliferative index had very strong {FDG} uptake, whereas those (n = 6) with low proliferative index or negative Ki-67 staining result had relatively lower {FDG} uptake. On delayed {FDG} {PET/CT} images, The {SUVmax} of {SPTP} increased in 4 patients and slightly decreased in 2 patients.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {CT} or {MRI} demonstrated morphological features of {SPTP} and {FDG} {PET/CT} that reflected the histopathological composition of the tumors. {FDG} uptake of {SPTP} may be related to tumor cellularity, proliferative index, or histological malignancy.

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} The present institutional review board-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ({HIPAA)-compliant} retrospective study evaluated 64 consecutive adults with pancreatic adenocarcinoma examined using a standardized, multiphasic protocol on a single-source, dual-energy {MDCT} system. Pancreatic phase images (35 s) were acquired in dual-energy mode; unenhanced and portal venous phases used standard {MDCT.} Lesion contrast was evaluated on an independent workstation using dual-energy analysis software, comparing tumour to non-tumoural pancreas attenuation ({HU)} differences and tumour diameter at three energy levels: 70 {keV;} individual subject-optimized viewing energy level (based on the maximum contrast-to-noise ratio, {CNR);} and 45 {keV.} The image noise was measured for the same three energies. Differences in lesion contrast, diameter, and noise between the different energy levels were analysed using analysis of variance ({ANOVA).} Quantitative differences in contrast gain between 70 {keV} and {CNR-optimized} viewing energies, and between {CNR-optimized} and 45 {keV} were compared using the paired t-test.
{RESULTS:} Thirty-four women and 30 men (mean age 68 years) had a mean tumour diameter of 3.6 cm. The median optimized energy level was 50 {keV} (range 40-77). The mean ± {SD} lesion contrast values (non-tumoural pancreas - tumour attenuation) were: 57 ± 29, 115 ± 70, and 146 ± 74 {HU} (p = 0.0005); the lengths of the tumours were: 3.6, 3.3, and 3.1 cm, respectively (p = 0.026); and the contrast to noise ratios were: 24 ± 7, 39 ± 12, and 59 ± 17 (p = 0.0005) for 70 {keV}, the optimized energy level, and 45 {keV}, respectively. For individuals, the mean ± {SD} contrast gain from 70 {keV} to the optimized energy level was 59 ± 45 {HU;} and the mean ± {SD} contrast gain from the optimized energy level to 45 {keV} was 31 ± 25 {HU} (p = 0.007).

It plays an important role in the multi-disciplinary evaluation and staging of pancreatic cancer as accurate staging has significant impact on treatment decisions.
{AREAS} {COVERED:} This review will cover the yield and utility of {EUS} and {EUS} {FNA} for diagnosis of pancreas cancer. In addition, this article reviews the utility and diagnostic yield of the non-invasive imaging modalities, including surface ultrasound, {CT} scan, {PET} {CT} scan and {MRI.} Tumor size, histology and disease processes that mimic pancreatic cancers will also be reviewed.
{EXPERT} {OPINION:} The accurate diagnosis and staging of pancreatic neoplasms is essential for optimal patient management. Abdominal imaging with multidetector {CT} or {MRI} is the most important initial step in the evaluation of pancreatic cancer because they are widely available and can detect most masses and/or demonstrate dilated bile or pancreatic ducts indicative of obstruction. Endoscopic ultrasound will remain important for detecting small tumors, ruling out diseases that mimic adenocarcinoma and for obtaining tissue diagnosis with fine needle aspiration.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an aggressive malignancy with the majority of patients dying within one year of diagnosis. While surgical resection with negative margins offers the only hope for cure only a small minority of patients  are amenable to resection at the time of diagnosis owing to the propensity for early metastasis. While most advances in the last several decades have revolved around improvements in surgical techniques and postoperative outcomes, some modest inroads have been made with modern chemotherapy. This review discusses the diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer and highlights some of the current  issues. A Medline database search was performed to identify relevant articles using the keywords "pancreatic adenocarcinoma", "diagnosis", {"CA19-9"}, "pancreaticoduodenectomy", "adjuvant therapy", "chemotherapy", and {"microRNA".} Additional papers were then identified by a manual search of the references from  the key articles. While high quality {CT} is often the only imaging modality needed for preoperative evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)}, cholangiography, and endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} have been utilized for diagnosis, staging, and/ or palliation. The controversies of pylorus preservation, extended lymphadenectomy, and laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy are discussed. Randomized controlled trials regarding the use of 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine  are also reviewed. Early detection and aggressive surgical resection in combination with protocol-driven adjuvant therapy and novel molecular approaches  are the only hope for cure. This review summarizes the recent literature on the abovementioned topics.},

	abstract = {Autoimmune pancreatitis ({AIP)} is a newly described entity of pancreatitis in which the pathogenesis appears to involve autoimmune mechanisms. Based on histological and immunohistochemical examinations of various organs of {AIP} patients, {AIP} appears to be a pancreatic lesion reflecting a systemic {"IgG4-related} sclerosing disease". Clinically, {AIP} patients and patients with pancreatic cancer share many features, such as preponderance of elderly males, frequent initial symptom of painless jaundice, development of new-onset diabetes  mellitus, and elevated levels of serum tumor markers. It is of uppermost importance not to misdiagnose {AIP} as pancreatic cancer. Since there is currently  no diagnostic serological marker for {AIP}, and approach to the pancreas for histological examination is generally difficult, {AIP} is diagnosed using a combination of clinical, serological, morphological, and histopathological features. Findings suggesting {AIP} rather than pancreatic cancer include: fluctuating obstructive jaundice; elevated serum {IgG4} levels; diffuse enlargement of the pancreas; delayed enhancement of the enlarged pancreas and presence of a capsule-like rim on dynamic computed tomography; low apparent diffusion coefficient values on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance image; irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; less upstream dilatation of the main pancreatic duct on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, presence of other organ involvement  such as bilateral salivary gland swelling, retroperitoneal fibrosis and hilar or  intrahepatic sclerosing cholangitis; negative work-up for malignancy including endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration; and steroid responsiveness.

It is clear that the future for pancreatic cancer lies in  early detection. While the possible presence of pancreatic masses is often first  raised by non-invasive abdominal imaging, such as computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, smaller lesions and locoregional lymph node metastases are often not detectable by these means. Endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS)} offers a higher sensitivity (93-100\%) for detection of small potentially curable pancreatic masses than other existing imaging modalities. It is also recommended for the evaluation of portal vein confluence, portal vein, celiac axis, and superior mesentric artery origin, and exclusion of resectability. Due to the closer proximity of {EUS} to the target structure, and lower rate of needle  tract seeding, {EUS-guided} fine-needle aspiration of pancreatic mass is considered the most suitable tissue acquisition technique. Lastly, {EUS} also enables the performance of endoscopic interventions. Its performance can be further enhanced  with newer techniques, including contrast-enhanced ultrasound and elastrography.  It is anticipated that in the near future, molecular technologies may make it possible to detect microscopic amounts of cancer in tissue or blood, predict relapse and survival after therapy, as well as determine optimal therapy.},

	volume = {58},
	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer ({PC)} is a highly lethal disease. Early diagnosis remains the only possibility nowadays for an intention to cure the disease, since prognosis of {PC} is significantly better in patients diagnosed of small ({\textless}2 cm), well differentiated, stages I and {II} pancreatic tumors. However, the best approach would be to detect precursor lesions, like Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ({IPMN)} or {PanIN} lesions. In this setting the best technique to diagnose  either small {PC} and/or {IPMN} and {PanIN} lesions is clearly endoscopic ultrasound. However, detection of these lesions is very difficult, hampered by the absence of clinical manifestations of {PC} at these early stages. The implementation of screening programs, which - given the incidence of {PC} - is not cost effective for the general population, in high-risk individuals, may lead to increase the detection of {PC} an early stages as well as precursor lesion. When focusing on treatment, {PC} patients are best cared by multidisciplinary teams. For patients with resectable disease surgery remains the treatment of choice, followed by postoperative treatment. When precursor lesions are detected, mainly {IPMN}, treatment should be individualized, following latest international guidelines.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} {McCune-Albright} syndrome ({MAS)}, which includes polycystic fibrous dysplasia, precocious puberty, and cafe au lait spots, is a rare disorder caused  by somatic activating mutations of the {GNAS} gene. {GNAS} mutations have also been implicated in various sporadic tumors, including hepatobiliary and pancreatic neoplasms. {AIM:} The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of hepatobiliary and pancreatic neoplasms in patients with {McCune-Albright} syndrome. {PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} Nineteen patients diagnosed between 1995 and 2012 with {MAS}  in a tertiary referral center for rare growth disorders were screened with dedicated gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for hepatobiliary and pancreatic neoplasms between June 2011 and December 2012. {RESULTS:} Six (32\%) of the 19 screened patients were found to have hepatic, pancreatic, or biliary lesions, excluding liver hemangiomas, liver cysts, and focal nodular hyperplasia. This includes pancreatic ductal lesions observed in 4 patients, including numerous branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms in 3 patients. Biliary lesions were observed in 1 patient, with a large choledochal cyst also involving the left biliary branch. Finally, multiple inflammatory/telangiectatic  hepatic adenomas were observed in 2 patients, including 1 with proven somatic {GNAS} mutation. {CONCLUSION:} We describe the first observation of syndromic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and the new association between {MAS} and  pancreatic neoplasms, namely intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms of the pancreas but also rare hepatobiliary neoplasms including liver adenomas and choledochal cysts. These findings strongly suggest that somatic activating {GNAS} mutations, possibly through {cAMP} pathway disorders, are involved in the tumorigenesis of hepatobiliary and pancreatic tissues originating from the foregut endoderm and have led us to use a routine screening by dedicated magnetic resonance imaging including both pancreatobiliary and liver sequences in patients with {MAS.}},

The demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, routine magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion weighted imaging ({DWI)} features with different b  values were reviewed. Continuous data were expressed as mean +/- {SD.} Comparisons  between pancreatic cancer and benign pancreatic tumors were performed using the Student's t test. A probability of P {\textless} 0.05 was considered statistically significant. {RESULTS:} Thirty-three patients with pancreatic cancer were identified. The mean age at diagnosis was 60 +/- 5.6 years. The male: female ratio was 21:12. Twenty cases were confirmed by surgical resection and 13 by biopsy of metastases. T1 weighted images demonstrated a pancreatic head mass in 16 patients, a pancreatic body mass in 10 cases, and a pancreatic tail mass with  pancreatic atrophy in 7 cases. Eight patients had hepatic metastases, 13 had invasion or envelopment of mesenteric vessels, 4 had bone metastases, and 8 had lymph node metastases. {DWI} demonstrated an irregular intense mass with unclear margins. Necrotic tissue demonstrated an uneven low signal. A b of 1100 s/mm(2) was associated with a high intensity signal with poor anatomical delineation. A b of 700 s/mm(2) was associated with apparent diffusion coefficients ({ADCs)} that were useful in distinguishing benign and malignant pancreatic tumors (P {\textless} 0.05).  b values of 50, 350, 400, 450 and 1100 s/mm(2) were associated with {ADCs} that did not differentiate the two tumors. {CONCLUSION:} Low b value images demonstrated superior anatomical details when compared to high b value images.

Four weeks later, they reviewed the other {MR} images for size of mass, double-duct sign, pancreatic duct  cutoff, and perivascular soft-tissue cuffing. A score for conventional {MRI} was given with 1 meaning definitely benign and 5 meaning definitely malignant. Univariate and multivariate analyses and receiver operating characteristic ({ROC)}  curve analysis were performed with surgical pathologic examination as the reference standard. {RESULTS:} The only finding that differentiated the two groups  was the presence of a well-defined mass, favoring the diagnosis of cancer (p = 0.02, p {\textless} 0.01). There was no significant difference between the two groups in signal intensity on {DW} images (p = 0.82, p = 0.85) or {ADC} (p = 0.51, p = 0.76).

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION:} Multi-row detector computed tomography ({MDCT)} and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ({MRCP)} play an important role in the imaging diagnosis of hepatobiliary-pancreatic lesions. Here we investigated whether unifying the {MDCT} and {MRCP} images onto the same screen using fusion imaging could overcome the limitations of each technique, while still maintaining their benefits. Moreover, because reports of fusion imaging using {MDCT} and {MRCP} are rare, we assessed the benefits and limitations of this method for its potential application in a clinical setting. {METHODS:} The patient group included 9 men and  11 women. Among the 20 patients, the final diagnoses were as follows: 10 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, 5 biliary system carcinomas, 1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 5 non-neoplastic lesions. After transmitting the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine data of the {MDCT} and {MRCP} images to a workstation, we performed a 3-D organisation of both sets of images using volume rendering for the image fusion. {RESULTS:} Fusion imaging enabled clear identification of the spatial relationship between a hepatobiliary-pancreatic lesion and the solid viscera and/or vessels. Further, this method facilitated the determination of the relationship between the anatomical position of the lesion and its surroundings more easily than either {MDCT} or {MRCP} alone. {CONCLUSION:} Fusion imaging is an easy technique to perform and may be a useful tool for planning treatment strategies and for examining pathological changes in hepatobiliary-pancreatic lesions. Additionally, the ease of obtaining the 3-D images suggests the possibility of using these images to plan intervention strategies.},

Serum immunoglobulin G ({IgG)} and/or {IgG4} was determined in patients with clinically suspected or pathologically proven {AIP.} Patients with suspected {AIP} either received diagnostic steroid therapy or laparotomy (if malignant tumors could not be excluded). Surgery was not performed in patients with a definite diagnosis of {AIP} by fast intraoperative frozen biopsy.

Of these 15 patients with {AIP} and one without {AIP}, 14 had elevated serum gamma-globulin levels. It was proven by subsequent antibody tests that serum {IgG} or {IgG4} were simultaneously increased. {CONCLUSIONS:} Elevated serum gamma-globulin level can be used as a preoperative sentinel indicator for differentiating between {IgG4-related} {AIP} and pancreatic malignancy.

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION:} {MRCP} enables a planar ductography of the pancreatobiliary system, which for diagnostic purposes may render {ERCP} unnecessary. However, the interpretation of {MRCP} findings is primarily performed by radiologists, and it is unclear whether additional interpretation of the {MRCP} results by the endoscopist  alters clinical management. {PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} One-hundred and fifty-five consecutive patients, who were referred for further endoscopic procedures ({EUS/ERCP)} based on {MRCP} findings (performed within 4 weeks prior to admittance;  a written radiological report as well as the digital images were available) were  enrolled. Before the endoscopic examinations were done, the {MRCP} images were re-evaluated by an experienced endoscopist who was in charge of the further endoscopic management. The interpretations of the {MRCP} images by the radiologist  and the endoscopist were then compared with the final diagnosis after the further endoscopic evaluation. Additionally, the recommendations made by the endoscopist  for further patient management before and after {MRCP} image analysis were evaluated. {RESULTS:} The {MRCP} image quality was judged sufficient by the endoscopist in the majority of the cases (80 {\%).The} diagnostic accuracy of the {MRCP} findings was 73 \% based on the interpretation by the radiologist and 86 \% from the interpretation of the endoscopist. In 14 patients the endoscopist scheduled an {EUS} instead of an {ERCP} after he had viewed the {MRCP} images. Overall, the endoscopic work-flow was modified by the additional interpretation of the {MRCP} by the endoscopist in 25/155 (16 \%) of the cases. {LIMITATIONS:} This is a non-randomized, unblinded single-observer assessment. {CONCLUSION:} {MRCP} images should be additionally interpreted by an endoscopist before further endoscopic procedures are scheduled.},

It is also a challenge to differentiate {PDA} from focal mass-forming pancreatitis  ({FMP).} There is controversy regarding the efficacy of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography ({FDG-PET)} in the diagnosis of {PDA.} We investigated whether {FDG-PET} provides information that, combined with data from other imaging  techniques, can aid in decision making for patients with suspected {PDA.} {METHODS:}  We performed a retrospective analysis of data collected from 232 consecutive patients with suspected {PDA} at Kobe University Hospital from January 2006 through June 2012. All patients underwent a diagnostic imaging protocol that included multidetector row computed tomography, superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, and {FDG-PET.} Based on endoscopic ultrasonography, fine-needle aspiration biopsy, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography  analyses, 218 patients had {PDA} (89 underwent resection and 129 did not) and 14 patients had {FMP} (8 had focal mass-forming chronic pancreatitis and 6 had focal mass-forming autoimmune pancreatitis). {RESULTS:} {FDG-PET} detected 50\% of stages 0  and I, 91.9\% of stage {II}, 100\% of stage {III}, and 96.8\% of stage {IV} tumors. Detection was affected significantly by tumor size (P = .024) and T stage (P = .023) in resected tumors. Multidetector row computed tomography detected significantly more liver metastases than {FDG-PET.} Few para-aortic lymph node or peritoneal metastases were detected by {FDG-PET.} {FDG-PET} correctly identified 11 of the 14 patients with {FMP} (5 of 8 with focal mass-forming chronic pancreatitis  and 6 of 6 with focal mass-forming autoimmune pancreatitis). {CONCLUSIONS:} {FDG-PET} is not effective in detecting early stage {PDA} and small metastases, or in differentiating {PDA} from {FMP.} Combining {FDG-PET} with current diagnostic techniques for {PDA} did not provide any decisive information, therefore it should  not be included in this analysis.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION:} Stroma reaction leading to fibrosis is the most characteristic histopathological feature of both pancreatic carcinoma and chronic pancreatitis with increased fibrosis compared with healthy pancreatic tissue and further increased fibrosis during radiochemotherapy. Recent studies using intravoxel incoherent motion-derived parameters did not show differences for structural diffusion constant D between these 2 diseases. The aim of this study was to verify the hypothesis that D correlates with the histopathological grade of fibrosis in pancreatic lesions. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} We included 15 patients with histopathologically proven pancreatic carcinoma and 9 patients with histopathologically proven focal chronic pancreatitis. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was performed using 10 b values between 25 and 800 s/mm(2) before surgery. We calculated the apparent diffusion coefficient and the  intravoxel incoherent motion-derived parameters D and f within tumors and focal chronic pancreatitis. The resected tissue was evaluated with regard to the grade  of fibrosis. {RESULTS:} Fourteen patients were found to have moderate fibrosis and  10 patients had severe fibrosis. The difference between the D values for the moderate and severe fibrosis was significant with mean ({SD)} D value of 1.02 x 10(-)(3) (0.48 x 10(-)(3) mm/s) and mean ({SD)} D of 1.22 x 10(-)(3) (0.76 x 10(-)(3)) mm(2)/s. There were no significant differences for the f and {ADC} values. {CONCLUSIONS:} Contrary to our hypothesis, D rises from moderate to severe  fibrosis. It seems that cellular complexes surrounded by fibrosis provide more structural limitations than does fibrosis alone. Our data suggest that D is not intuitively related to the degree of fibrosis. Compared with healthy tissue, D is reduced in moderate fibrosis but increases when severe fibrosis is present.},

A total of 45 patients suspected of having biliary or pancreatic disease underwent pancreatic {MR} examination with  a 3.0-T imager with a low-dose (2 {mL} gadopentetate dimeglumine) timing bolus by using the radial {KWIC} technique. There were 24 patients with pancreatic cancers,  eight with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ({PNETs)}, three with chronic pancreatitis, and 10 with a normal pancreas. By using a dedicated postprocessing  software program for {DCE} {MR} imaging, the following perfusion parameters were measured for tumor and nontumorous parenchyma: volume transfer coefficient (K(trans)) and extracellular extravascular volume fraction; the rate constant (k(ep)) and initial area under the concentration curve in 60 seconds ({iAUC)} were  then generated. The perfusion parameters acquired on {DCE} {MR} images were compared  among the groups by using the analysis of variance test. {RESULTS:} K(trans), k(ep), and {iAUC} values in patients with pancreatic cancer (0.042 min(-1) +/- 0.023 [standard deviation], 0.761 min(-1) +/- 0.529, and 2.841 mmol/sec +/- 1.811, respectively) were significantly lower than in patients with a normal pancreas (0.387 min(-1) +/- 0.176, 6.376 min(-1) +/- 2.529, and 7.156 mmol/sec +/- 3.414, respectively) (P {\textless} .05 for all).

The enhancement of liver, pancreas, and {FNH} was evaluated quantitatively on {MR} images. {RESULTS:} The relative enhancement of liver in {HADP} in the gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced group in all subjects was significantly higher than that in gadoxetic acid-enhanced group (P = 0.023). The gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced group in {HADP} had better relative enhancement of pancreas and {FNH}, pancreas-to-liver index, and {FNH-to-liver} index than gadoxetic acid-enhanced group, but the difference was not statistically significant. {CONCLUSION:} The 0.05 mmol/kg gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced abdominal {MRI} studies at {3T} and {1.5T} {MR} systems are superior in relative enhancement of the liver in {HADP} to 0.025 mmol/kg gadoxetic acid-enhanced {MRI.} This type of assessment may provide comparative effectiveness data.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10620-012-2387-x},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {AIM:} Sporadic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ({PDA)} is a highly lethal cancer. No proven screening strategies are available and frequent cross-sectional imaging studies ({CT/MRI)} are impractical even in patients thought to be at higher risk than the general population. Few {PDA} biomarkers have been studied prospectively for screening. Here, we prospectively evaluated the Adnab-9 monoclonal antibody in stool, pancreaticobiliary secretions, and tissue for screening and prognostic value in sporadic {PDA.} We also evaluated the prognostic  value of characterized early biomarkers in pancreaticobiliary secretions. {METHODS:} Adnab-9 diagnostic ability was tested in stool in 249 and 1,132 patients from China and the {US}, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 22 tissue samples with Adnab-9 antibody and anti-Defensin 5, a constituent of Paneth cells. Pancreatobiliary secretions were collected from 12 {PDA} patients and 9 controls. The enriched {PCR} method was performed to detect K-ras mutations. {ELISA}  was performed with Adnab-9, anti-Her-2/neu, and monoclonal antibody D4 (anti-Reg  I). {RESULTS:} Adnab-9 alone was diagnostic and prognostic when measured in pancreatic secretions, feces, and tissues of {PDA} patients compared to controls (p {\textless} 0.05). Significantly, Adnab-9 fecal binding can precede the clinical diagnosis  by 2.3 years, potentially allowing earlier clinical intervention. In pancreatic secretions, a combination of K-ras and Her-2/neu when appropriately standardized  can be diagnostic in 75 \% of {PDA.} {CONCLUSIONS:} Our study suggests that Adnab-9 may be an effective marker for diagnosis and prognosis of {PDA.} Adnab-9 may be reflective of the presence of Paneth cells confirmed by Defensin-5 staining. These cells may modulate the biological activity of the cancer and confer a better prognosis.},

	abstract = {{AIM:} To describe the frequency of normal variation in contour of the head and uncinate process of the pancreas in patients with intestinal malrotation, some of which can mimic neoplasm, and their relationship with mesenteric vascular inversion. {METHODS:} A retrospective analysis of 25 cases of intestinal malrotation on cross-sectional imaging [24 computed tomography ({CT)} examinations, one magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} examination], was performed by two specialist gastrointestinal radiologists. The presence and type of intestinal malrotation, variations in pancreatic contour, and the location of the superior mesenteric vessels were analysed. {RESULTS:} Twenty-five cases of malrotation (21 complete, four partial) with a median age of 50 years (range 17-91 years) were reviewed. Eighty-six percent (18/21) of complete malrotation cases demonstrated an unusual pancreatic contour. There was hypoplasia or aplasia of the uncinate process in 86\% (18/21) of cases. Both uncinate process and pancreatic head contour anomalies were demonstrated in 57\% (12/21) of cases, which included 24\% (5/21) with a globular-shaped enlargement of the head of pancreas. Mesenteric vascular inversion was seen in 90\% (19/21) of cases. One hundred percent (4/4) of partial malrotation cases had normal pancreatic and vascular anatomy. {CONCLUSION:} Pancreatic contour variations are common in malrotation and the enlargement of the pancreatic head in some cases can mimic a neoplasm. The embryological cause may be due to anomalous fusion of the ventral bud of the pancreas with the dorsal bud, explaining the common finding of a small uncinate process with a large pancreatic head.},

Pooled sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio, summary receiver operating characteristic ({SROC)} curve and area under curve ({AUC)} were analysed by {SPSS} 13.0 and Revmen 5.1. {RESULTS:} Eight studies (n = 296) met the inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivity of {CT} and {MRI} in diagnosing {VI} was 71\% (95\% {CI}, 64-78) and 67\% (95\% {CI}, 59-74), pooled specificity 92\% (95\% {CI}, 89-95) and 94\% (95\% {CI}, 91-96), positive likelihood ratio 6.33 (95\% {CI}, 4.51-8.87) and 6.58 (95\% {CI}, 4.62-9.37),  negative likelihood ratio 0.34 (95\% {CI}, 0.27-0.43) and 0.38 (95\% {CI}, 0.30-0.47),  and {AUCs} 0.87 and 0.76 (p = 0.63), respectively.

Eighty patients with histologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mean tumor size, 32 mm) underwent fat-suppressed single-shot echo-planar 3.0-T diffusion-weighted {MR} imaging with diffusion gradients (b = 1000 sec/mm(2)). {ADC}  values of the pancreatic adenocarcinomas (n = 80) and proximal (n = 51) and distal (n = 70) pancreas were compared by using the Friedman test, followed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the difference in serum amylase levels between pancreatic adenocarcinomas with and without clear hyperintensity was evaluated by using the x(2) test. {RESULTS:} In 38 of 80 patients, pancreatic adenocarcinomas showed clear hyperintensity relative to the surrounding pancreas; 26 were hyperintense with unclear distal borders; 12, isointense; and four, hypointense.  In all patients, the mean {ADC} (+/- standard deviation) of the tumors (1.16 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec +/- 0.22) was significantly lower than those of the proximal pancreas (1.33 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec +/- 0.16, P {\textless} .001) and the distal pancreatic parenchyma (1.24 x 10(-3) mm(2)/sec +/- 0.23, P = .004).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Pancreatic fistula ({PF)} is considered to be the main cause of morbidity after pancreaticoduodenectomy ({PD).} A recent study from our institution suggested the risk for pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy to be closely related to the pancreatic remnant volume ({PRV).} The hypothesis was formulated that after {PD} the {PRV} is an important determinant of the risk for {PF} formation. {METHOD:} All patients undergoing {PD} between September 2007 and November 2010 at the Karolinska University Hospital Stockholm were included. Preoperative  multidetector computed tomography ({CT)} or magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} was used to calculate the {PRV} and the pancreatic duct width ({PDW)} at the alleged resection line. {RESULTS:} A total of 182 patients (median age 67 years) undergoing {PD} were included. The diagnosis was malignant in 144 patients (79.1 \%) and benign in 38 (20.9 \%). Pancreatic fistula defined according to the International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula ({ISGPF)} criteria was diagnosed in 37 patients (20.3 \%). The median {PRV} was 35.2 cm(3) and the median {PDW} was 3.9 mm. In a univariate  analysis a large calculated volume of the pancreatic remnant increased the subsequent risk of {PF} (odds ratio [{OR]}, 3.71; 95\% confidence interval [95\% {CI]}, 1.58-8.71; P {\textless} 0.01), as did a small duct width ({OR}, 8.46; 95\% {CI}, 3.11-23.04; P  {\textless} 0.01). According to the multivariate analysis, the size of the pancreatic remnant and the width of the pancreatic duct maintained their impact on leakage risk. {CONCLUSIONS:} A large pancreatic volume and small pancreatic duct increase the risk of {PF.} Preoperative {CT} and/or {MRI} therefore are useful in predicting fistula formation before pancreaticoduodenectomy.},

Although the pancreas is one of the most frequently involved organs, the frequency of pancreatic cysts, cystadenomas, neuroendocrine tumors and diabetes has not been sufficiently evaluated due to the low prevalence of this disease. In this paper,  we review and retrospectively analyze 11 patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. {METHODOLOGY:} Eleven patients (6 males, 5 females) who underwent {CT} or {MRI} scans at Okayama University Hospital between 2002 and 2009 were enrolled in this study. Their pancreatic {CT} scans, {MRI} scans, biochemical test results and clinical histories were retrospectively reviewed. {RESULTS:} All patients had one or more pancreatic involvements. Nine of the 11 patients had multiple pancreatic cysts, 2 had dilatation of the main pancreatic duct, 3 had a non-functioning pancreatic endocrine tumor (one patient required pancreatoduodenectomy due to the endocrine  carcinoma) and 3 had diabetes mellitus. Pancreatic cystadenomas were not detected in this case series. {CONCLUSIONS:} The prevalence of pancreatic involvement was 100\% in this study. Regular screening and scheduled follow-up for pancreatic lesions and diabetes should be performed on individuals predisposed to von Hippel-Lindau disease.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} \& {AIMS:} The risk of pancreatic cancer is increased in patients with a  strong family history of pancreatic cancer or a predisposing germline mutation. Screening can detect curable, noninvasive pancreatic neoplasms, but the optimal imaging approach is not known. We determined the baseline prevalence and characteristics of pancreatic abnormalities using 3 imaging tests to screen asymptomatic, high-risk individuals ({HRIs).} {METHODS:} We screened 225 asymptomatic adult {HRIs} at 5 academic {US} medical centers once, using computed tomography ({CT)}, magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)}, and endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS).} We compared results in a blinded, independent fashion. {RESULTS:} Ninety-two of 216 {HRIs} (42\%) were found to have at least 1 pancreatic mass (84 cystic, 3 solid) or  a dilated pancreatic duct (n = 5) by any of the imaging modalities. Fifty-one of  the 84 {HRIs} with a cyst (60.7\%) had multiple lesions, typically small (mean, 0.55 cm; range, 2-39 mm), in multiple locations. The prevalence of pancreatic lesions  increased with age; they were detected in 14\% of subjects younger than 50 years old, 34\% of subjects 50-59 years old, and 53\% of subjects 60-69 years old (P {\textless} .0001). {CT}, {MRI}, and {EUS} detected a pancreatic abnormality in 11\%, 33.3\%, and 42.6\% of the {HRIs}, respectively. Among these abnormalities, proven or suspected neoplasms were identified in 85 {HRIs} (82 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and 3 pancreatic endocrine tumors). Three of 5 {HRIs} who underwent pancreatic resection had high-grade dysplasia in less than 3 cm intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and in multiple intraepithelial neoplasias. {CONCLUSIONS:} Screening of asymptomatic {HRIs} frequently detects small pancreatic cysts, including curable, noninvasive high-grade neoplasms. {EUS} and {MRI} detect pancreatic lesions better than {CT.}},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} : The success of any surveillance program depends not solely on its technological aspects but also on the commitment of participants to adhere to follow-up investigations, which is influenced by the psychological impact of surveillance. This study investigates the psychological impact of participating in a pancreatic cancer surveillance program. {METHODS:} : High-risk individuals participating in an endoscopic ultrasonography-magnetic resonance imaging-based pancreatic cancer surveillance program received a questionnaire assessing experiences with endoscopic ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, reasons to participate, psychological distress, and benefits and barriers of surveillance. High-risk individuals were individuals with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer or carriers of pancreatic cancer-prone gene mutations. {RESULTS:} : Sixty-nine participants (85\%) completed the questionnaire. Surveillance was reported as "very to extremely uncomfortable" by 15\% for magnetic resonance imaging and 14\% for endoscopic ultrasonography. Most reported  reason to participate was that pancreatic cancer might be detected in a curable stage. Abnormalities were detected in 27 respondents, resulting in surgical resection in one individual and a shorter follow-up interval in five individuals. Surveillance outcomes did not influence cancer worries. Overall, 29\% was "often"  or "almost always" concerned about developing cancer. Six respondents (9\%) had clinical levels of depression and/or anxiety. According to 88\% of respondents, advantages of surveillance outweighed disadvantages. {CONCLUSIONS:} : Although endoscopic ultrasonography is more invasive than magnetic resonance imaging, endoscopic ultrasonography was not perceived as more burdensome. Despite one third of respondents worrying frequently about cancer, this was not related to the surveillance outcomes. Anxiety and depression levels were comparable with the general population norms. Advantages of participation outweighed disadvantages according to the majority of respondents. From a psychological point of view, pancreatic cancer surveillance in high-risk individuals is feasible and justified.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND/AIM:} This study examined the clinical characteristics and surgical outcomes of solid pseudopapillary tumors of the pancreas ({SPT).} {METHODOLOGY:} Cases of {SPT} encountered in our hospital between January 1994 and December 2009 were reviewed retrospectively. The clinicopathological factors in the benign and  malignant cases were compared to determine what features of the tumor could suggest malignant potential. {RESULTS:} Thirty patients with {SPT} were identified: 26 females and 4 males with a average age of 30.5 years (range 9-66). The median  size of the tumors was 6.2cm (range 1.25 to 15.0). Tumors were located in the head (50\%), neck (3.3\%), body (16.7\%) and tail (30\%) of the pancreas. Surgical procedures included a local tumor resection (10 cases) or radical resection, such as a pancreaticoduodenectomy (6 cases), central pancreatectomy (1 case) or distal pancreatectomy (13 cases). There was no recurrence after the surgical resection.  All patients were alive at a median follow-up of 58 months (range 6 to 187). Among the clinico-pathological factors, the presence of calcification was associated with the malignant potential ({OR=16.000}, 95\% {CI=1.451-176.451}, p=0.024). {CONCLUSIONS:} {SPT} is a less aggressive pancreatic neoplasm that differs  from other pancreatic cancers. The prognosis is favorable after a surgical resection. The presence of calcification is a predictive factor for a malignant {SPT.}},

Two gastrointestinal radiologists independently recorded specific morphological features of tumors and the most likely diagnosis. {RESULTS:} With respect to specific histopathological characterization, {CT} and {MRI} were equally accurate. The mean number of correct diagnoses made by the two reviewers was 37.5 (88.4\%) of 42 cases for {CT} compared to 12 (75\%) of 16 cases for {MRI} (p=0.388). Location in the pancreatic head (p=0.000), presence of dilatation of {MPD} (p=0.000), presence of dilatation of {CBD} (p=0.001) and enhancement pattern (p=0.000) were statistically significant for differentiating {PDAC} from the other small solid pancreatic tumors, while pancreatic atrophy (p=0.069) was statistically inadequate for differentiation, although it gave a 96.4\% specificity for the diagnosis of {PDAC.} {CONCLUSIONS:} {CT} and {MRI} are similarly accurate in the characterization of small solid pancreatic tumors.

This study included 100 patients (53 men, 47 women; mean age, 67.8 years) consisting of 54 patients with pathologically confirmed pancreatic carcinoma (mean size, 33 mm) and 46 without a pancreatic lesion. Sixty-two liver metastases (mean size, 10 mm) in 15 patients with pancreatic carcinoma were diagnosed at pathologic examination or multimodality assessment. Three readers blinded to the final diagnosis interpreted all {MR} (precontrast T1- and T2-weighted and gadoxetic acid-enhanced dynamic and hepatocyte phase {MR} images) and tetraphasic dynamic contrast-enhanced {CT} images and graded the presence (or absence) of pancreatic carcinoma and liver metastasis on patient-by-patient and lesion-by-lesion bases.

	abstract = {{AIM:} To investigate the markers of pancreatic diseases and provide basic data and experimental methods for the diagnosis of pancreatic diseases. {METHODS:} There were 15 patients in the present study, among whom 10 had pancreatic cancer and 5, chronic pancreatitis. In all patients, pancreatic cancer or chronic pancreatitis  was located on the head of the pancreas. Pathology data of all patients was confirmed by biopsy and surgery. Among the 10 patients with pancreatic cancer, 3  people had a medical history of long-term alcohol consumption. Of 5 patients with chronic pancreatitis, 4 men suffered from alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic juice samples were obtained from patients by endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography. Magnetic resonance spectroscopyn was performed on an 11.7-T scanner (Bruker {DRX-500)} using Call-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill pulse sequences.  The parameters were as follows: spectral width, 15 {KHz;} time domain, 64 K; number of scans, 512; and acquisition time, 2.128 s. {RESULTS:} The main component of pancreatic juice included leucine, iso-leucine, valine, lactate, alanine, acetate, aspartate, lysine, glycine, threonine, tyrosine, histidine, tryptophan,  and phenylalanine. On performing {1D} ({1)H} and {2D} total correlation spectroscopy, we found a triplet peak at the chemical shift of 1.19 ppm, which only appeared in the spectra of pancreatic juice obtained from patients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis. This triplet peak was considered the resonance of the methyl of ethoxy group, which may be associated with the metabolism of alcohol in the pancreas. {CONCLUSION:} The triplet peak, at the chemical shift of 1.19 ppm is likely to be the characteristic metabolite of alcoholic chronic pancreatitis.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} High-quality preoperative cross-sectional imaging is vital to accurately stage patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ({PDAC).} We hypothesized that imaging performed at a high-volume pancreatic cancer center with pancreatic imaging protocols more accurately stages patients compared with pre-referral imaging. {METHODS:} We retrospectively reviewed data from all patients with {PDAC} who presented to the surgical oncology clinic at our institution between June 2005 and August 2009. Detailed preoperative imaging, staging, and operative data were collected for each patient. {RESULTS:} A total of 230 patients  with {PDAC} were identified, of which 169 had pre-referral imaging. Patients were selectively reimaged at our institution based on the quality and timing of imaging at the outside facility: 108 (47\%) patients were deemed resectable, 54 (23.5\%) were deemed borderline-resectable, and 68 (29.5\%) were deemed unresectable. Of the resectable patients, 99 opted for resection. Eighty-two of those 99 patients underwent preoperative imaging at our institution, and of these 27\% had unresectable disease at the time of surgery compared with 47\% of patients who only had pre-referral imaging (p = 0.14). Reimaging altered staging and changed management in 56\% of patients. Among that group were 55 patients, categorized as resectable on pre-referral imaging, who on repeat imaging were deemed to be borderline resectable (n = 27) or unresectable (n = 28). {CONCLUSIONS:} Pancreas-protocol imaging at a high-volume center improves preoperative staging and alters management in a significant proportion of patients with {PDAC} who undergo pre-referral imaging. Thus, repeat imaging with pancreas protocols and dedicated radiologists is justified at high-volume centers.},

	abstract = {Diffusion-based intravoxel incoherent motion imaging has recently gained interest as a method to detect and characterize pancreatic lesions, especially as it could provide a radiation- and contrast agent-free alternative to existing diagnostic methods. However, tumor delineation on intravoxel incoherent motion-derived parameter maps is impeded by poor lesion-to-pancreatic duct contrast in the f-maps and poor lesion-to-vessel contrast in the D-maps. The distribution of the  diffusion and perfusion parameters within vessels, ducts, and tumors were extracted from a group of 42 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Clearly separable combinations of f and D were observed, and receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to determine the optimal cutoff values for an automated segmentation of vessels and ducts to improve lesion detection and delineation on the individual intravoxel incoherent motion-derived maps. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified f = 0.28 as the cutoff for vessels (Area under the curve ({AUC)} = 0.901) versus tumor/duct and D = 1.85 mum(2) /ms for separating duct from tumor tissue ({AUC} = 0.988). These values were incorporated in an automatic segmentation algorithm and then applied to 42 patients. This yielded clearly improved tumor delineation compared to individual  intravoxel incoherent motion-derived maps. Furthermore, previous findings that indicated that the f value in pancreatic cancer is strongly reduced compared to healthy pancreatic tissue were reconfirmed.},

Vessel infiltration was determined in 22 patients who underwent surgery, and reader 1 obtained sensitivities and specificities of 90\% (nine of 10 vessels) and 98\% (119 of 122 vessels), respectively, for {CT} and 80\% (eight of 10 vessels) and 96\% (117 of 122 vessels) for {MR} imaging; for reader 2,  those values were 70\% (seven of 10 vessels) and 98\% (120 of 122 vessels) for {CT} and 50\% (five of 10 vessels) and 98\% (120 of 122 vessels) for {MR} imaging. Both readers correctly assessed resectability in 87\% (13 of 15 patients) of cases with {CT} and 93\% (14 of 15 patients) of cases with {MR} imaging. Nonresectability was assessed correctly with {CT} in 75\% (six of eight patients) of cases by reader 1 and 63\% (five of eight patients) of cases by reader 2; nonresectability was correctly assessed with {MR} imaging in 75\% (six of eight patients) of cases by reader 1 and 50\% (four of eight patients) of cases by reader 2. None of the differences between modalities and readers were statistically significant (P {\textgreater} .05). {CONCLUSION:} Both {CT} and {MR} imaging are equally suited for detecting and staging pancreatic cancer. {SUPPLEMENTAL} {MATERIAL:} http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101189/-{/DC1.}},

Histopathologic characteristics and grades of differentiation of adenocarcinomas were analyzed. Twenty-one patients without a known history of pancreatic disease were evaluated as the control group.

The difference in mean apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC)} values among groups of normal pancreatic parenchyma, adenocarcinomas with poor differentiation, and adenocarcinomas with well/moderate differentiation were compared using one-way analysis of variance. {RESULTS:} Mean {ADCs} of pancreatic adenocarcinomas (1.77 +/-  0.45 x 10(-)(3) mm(2)/sec) was not significantly lower than that of normal parenchyma (1.98 +/- 0.31) (P = 0.09).

The patients were studied using intravoxel incoherent motion {DWI} with 11 b-values and the apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC)}, the true diffusion constant (D) and the perfusion fraction (f) were calculated. The diagnostic strength of the parameters was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis. {RESULTS:} The {ADC} in chronic pancreatitis was higher than in pancreatic carcinoma with significant differences at b = 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300 s/mm ({ADC50} = 3.17 +/- 0.67 vs. 2.55 +/- 1.09, {ADC75} = 2.46 +/- 0.4 vs.  1.93 +/- 0.52, {ADC100} = 2.28 +/- 0.48 vs. 1.73 +/- 0.45, {ADC150} = 1.97 +/- 0.26 vs. 1.63 +/- 0.40, {ADC200} = 1.98 +/- 0.24 vs. 1.53 +/- 0.28, and {ADC300} = 1.76 +/- 0.19 vs. 1.46 +/- 0.31 x 10(-3) mm2/s).

There was no significant difference between groups for D (1.07 +/- 0.224 x 10(-3) mm2/s for chronic pancreatitis and 1.09 +/- 0.3 x 10(-3) mm2/s for pancreatic carcinoma, P = 0.66). For f, the highest area under the curve (0.894) and combined sensitivity (80\%) and specificity (89.9\%) were found. {CONCLUSIONS:} There were significant differences in {ADC50-300} between chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma. Because D is not significantly different between groups, differences in {ADC} can be attributed mainly to differences in perfusion.

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer represents one of the most deadly human malignancies with an overall 5-year survival of less than 5\%. Despite improvements in imaging techniques and surgical techniques, survival statistics have hardly improved over the past decades. To improve the dismal outlook it would be highly desirable to develop a program to detect precursor lesions or small asymptomatic early cancers at the time when the disease is still at a curable stage. Screening the general population for disease presence is not feasible at present because of the relatively low disease incidence and the lack of a noninvasive, reliable and cheap screening tool. Targeted surveillance programs, however, in individuals at  high risk for developing pancreatic cancer, like mutation carriers of pancreatic  cancer prone hereditary (tumor) syndromes or individuals with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer without a known underlying genetic defect, might be  feasible. Careful consideration of the criteria put forward by Wilson and Jungner as published by the World Health Organization on the principles and practice of screening for disease, indicate that surveillance in this high-risk population by means of endosonography ({EUS)} and/or magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} represents  a promising development, though experimental. It nicely points out which open questions need to be addressed. Among others, these include how to acquire a better understanding of the natural behavior and progression of precursor lesions towards invasive cancer, how to firmly establish the performance characteristics  of {EUS} and {MRI} for the detection of (early) lesions in individuals at high risk for pancreatic cancer, and how to determine which lesions can be safely observed  with continued surveillance and which lesions justify resection.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} To prospectively evaluate the utility of dynamic contrast material-enhanced magnetic resonance ({MR)} imaging in predicting the response of locally advanced pancreatic cancer to combined chemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} This prospective, institutional review board-approved, {HIPAA-compliant} study with informed consent assessed dynamic contrast-enhanced {MR} imaging in 11 patients (mean age, 54.3 years; six men and five women) with locally invasive pancreatic cancer before and 28 days after combined chemotherapy and antiangiogenic therapy. Axial perfusion images were obtained after injection of 0.1 mmol gadopentetate dimeglumine per kilogram of body weight. Sagittal images of the upper abdominal aorta were obtained for arterial input function calculation. A two-compartment kinetic model was used to  calculate the perfusion parameters K(trans) (the rate constant that represents transfer of contrast agent from the arterial blood into the extravascular extracellular space), K(ep) (the rate constant that represents transfer of contrast agent from the extravascular extracellular space to the blood plasma), and volume of distribution (v(e)). Semiquantitative measurements, peak tissue gadolinium concentration (C(peak)), maximum slope of gadolinium increase (slope), and area under the gadolinium curve at 60 seconds ({AUC(60))} were also calculated. Perfusion parameters and tumor size changes were correlated with carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels. Comparisons between pre- and posttreatment studies were performed by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and comparisons between responders and nonresponders were performed by using the Mann-Whitney test. {RESULTS:} After therapy, K(trans), v(e), C(peak), slope, and {AUC(60)} decreased significantly (P = .02, .001, .002, .007, and .01, respectively). Tumor size and  K(ep) were not significantly changed. Pretreatment K(trans) and K(ep) were significantly higher (P = .02 and .006, respectively) in tumors that showed marker response than in those that did not. A pretreatment K(trans) value (milliliters of blood per milliliter of tissue times minutes) of more than 0.78 {mL/mL} . min was 100\% sensitive and 71\% specific for subsequent tumor response. Semiquantative parameters and tumor size were not different between the groups. {CONCLUSION:} Pretreatment K(trans) measurement in pancreatic tumors can predict response to antiangiogenic therapy.

	volume = {53},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Despite advances in preoperative staging, cancer of the pancreatic head is frequently found to be unresectable at laparotomy. We sought to identify  potential areas of improvement in preoperative staging. {METHODS:} We performed a retrospective institutional review of patients referred for resection of cancer of the pancreatic head over a 2-year period. The primary outcome was the rate of  metastasis or unresectable disease found at laparotomy in patients who were booked for pancreaticoduodenectomy with curative intent. {RESULTS:} During the study period, 133 patients were referred with suspected cancer of the pancreatic  head. All underwent preoperative computed tomography scanning. Twenty-four also underwent preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS)} and 23 also underwent magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI).} In total, 78 patients were deemed not to be candidates for surgery, leaving 55 patients with potentially resectable cancer who were scheduled for pancreaticoduodenectomy. Of these, 32 patients (58\%) underwent successful resection with curative intent, and 23 patients (42\%) were found to have metastatic or locally advanced disease not identified by preoperative staging. Reasons for nonresectability were metastases (9 patients, 16\%), vascular involvement (12 patients, 22\%) and mesentery involvement (2 patients, 4\%). One patient had a diagnostic laparoscopy immediately before planned open exploration and was found to have peritoneal seeding precluding curative resection. Of the patients who underwent {EUS}, 14 were not surgical candidates because of locally advanced tumours. Ten patients were offered surgery with curative intent, and 5 patients (50\%) were found have unresectable tumours (4 metastatic, 1 locally advanced). Of the patients who underwent {MRI}, 11 were offered surgery, and 5 (45\%) had unresectable tumours (2 metastatic, 3 locally advanced disease). {CONCLUSION:} In our institution, preoperative staging for cancer of the pancreatic head misses a substantial number of metastatic and unresectable disease. There is clearly room for improvement, and newer technologies should be evaluated to enhance the detection of metastatic and locally advanced disease to prevent unnecessary laparotomy.},

Poorly enhanced areas were classified according to their  size, attenuation value, position, and border on {CT} imaging and signal intensity  on magnetic resonance imaging. {RESULTS:} Of the 33 {PEAs}, 12 showed neoplastic duct-like structure that contained both large tumor gland and dilated pancreatic  duct with atypia, 11 showed necrosis, 4 showed retention cyst, 2 showed dilated pancreatic duct without atypia or with limited invasion, 1 showed mucin, and 3 showed no remarkable differences in characteristics compared with surrounding tissue. Neoplastic duct-like structures tended to be well defined (P {\textless} 0.01). Necrotic portions tended to show a high attenuation value (P {\textless} 0.01) and central  position (P {\textless} 0.01) and were ill defined (P {\textless} 0.01). Retention cysts tended to show a peripheral position (P {\textless} 0.01). {CONCLUSIONS:} Poorly enhanced areas corresponded to cystic, necrotic, and mucinous components.

	abstract = {Despite technological advances in computed tomography ({CT)} and magnetic resonance imaging, the involvement of the celiac or mesenteric artery in pancreatic cancer  remains uncertain in many cases. Infiltration of these vessels is important in making decisions about therapy choices but often can only be definitively determined through laparotomy. Local (intraarterial) ultrasound may increase diagnostic accuracy. Using the Volcano intravascular ultrasound ({IVUS)} system, we applied a transfemoral method to scan the celiac and mesenteric arteries directly intraarterial. This technique was used in five patients with suspected pancreatic cancer. Technical success was achieved in all cases. In one case, a short dissection of the mesenteric artery occurred but could be managed interventionally. In tumors that did not contact with the vessels, {IVUS} was unable to display the tissue pathology. Our main interest was the infiltration of the arteries. In one case, infiltration was certain in the {CT} scan but uncertain  in two patients. In the latter two cases, {IVUS} correctly predicted infiltration in one and freedom from tumor in the other case. In our preliminary study, {IVUS} correctly predicted arterial infiltration in all cases. {IVUS} did not provide new  information when the tumor was far away from the vessel. Compared with {IVUS} in the portal vein, the information about the artery is more detailed, and the vessel approach is easier. These results encouraged us to design a prospective study to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of this method.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:} We sought to clarify the clinical utility of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ({DWI)} for differentiating autoimmune pancreatitis ({AIP)} from pancreatic cancer. {METHODS:} Thirteen {AIP} patients underwent {DWI} before therapy, and six of them underwent {DWI} after steroid therapy. The extent and shape of high-intensity areas were compared with those of 40 pancreatic cancer patients. Apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC)} values were calculated in the {AIP}  area before and after steroid therapy in pancreatic cancer patients and in a normal pancreatic body. {RESULTS:} On {DWI}, {AIP} and pancreatic cancer were detected  as high-signal intensity areas. The high-intensity areas were diffuse (n=4), solitary (n=6), and multiple (n=3) in {AIP} patients, but all pancreatic cancer patients showed solitary areas (P{\textless}0.001). A nodular shape was significantly more  frequent in pancreatic cancer, and a longitudinal shape was more frequently found in {AIP} (P=0.005). {ADC} values were significantly lower in {AIP} (1.012+/-0.112 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) than in pancreatic cancer (1.249+/-0.113 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) and normal pancreas (1.491+/-0.162 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s) (P{\textless}0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded an optimal {ADC} cutoff value of 1.075 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s to distinguish {AIP} from pancreatic cancer. After steroid therapy, high-intensity areas on {DWI} disappeared or were markedly decreased, and the {ADC} values of the reduced pancreatic lesions increased almost to the values of normal pancreas. {CONCLUSIONS:} {DWI} is useful for detecting {AIP} and for evaluating the effect of steroid therapy. {ADC} values were significantly lower in {AIP} than in pancreatic cancer. An {ADC} cutoff value may be useful for distinguishing {AIP} from  pancreatic cancer.},

Few reports on concomitant trends in pancreatic cancer incidence, diagnosis, mortality and survival exist at the national level. This study provides a baseline overview of the temporal patterns in these four indicators over the past four decades in Norway. {MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS:} We analysed trends in incidence, basis of diagnosis, relative survival and mortality from the Cancer Registry of Norway for the period 1965-2007. {RESULTS:} Included were 21,663 patients with pancreatic cancers. Incidence and mortality rates remained at around 6-8 per 100,000 over the study period. Diagnoses based on clinical examination alone dropped from 12.5\% (in the 1950s) to {\textless}1\% (in the 2000s), while use of imaging techniques, such as {CT} and {MRI}, increased from 3.6\%  to {\textgreater}30\%. Previously high rates of autopsy-verified diagnosis and non-therapeutic  surgery decreased accordingly. Consistently more primary tumours (from 12.9\% to 19.4\%) and metastases (from 12.5\% to 22.4\%) had histological examination, and use of endoscopy increased to approximately 10\%. Relative survival after diagnosis of pancreatic cancer remains very low. However, in recent years, a modest improvement in short-term survival has been noted, with 1-year survival rates of  18\% and 16\% for males and females, respectively. {CONCLUSIONS:} The incidence and mortality for pancreatic cancer remain largely unchanged, with few 5-year survivors. Improved short-term survival may reflect more aggressive use of surgery and chemotherapy.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:} To evaluate in detail the diagnostic performance of diffusion-weighted imaging ({DWI)} to differentiate pancreas carcinoma from healthy pancreas using the apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC)} and parameters derived from the intravoxel incoherent motion ({IVIM)} theory. {MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Twenty-three patients with pancreas carcinoma and 14 volunteers with healthy pancreas were examined at 1.5 Tesla using a single-shot echo-planar imaging {DWI} pulse sequence. Eleven b-values ranging from 0 to 800 s/mm2 were used. The acquisition was separated into blocks (b0, b25), (b0, b50),...(b0, b800) and each block was acquired in a single expirational breath-hold ({TA} = 26 seconds) to avoid motion artifacts. The {ADC} was calculated for all b-values using linear regression yielding {ADC(tot).} By applying the {IVIM} model, which allows for the estimation of perfusion effects in {DWI}, the perfusion fraction f and the perfusion free diffusion parameter D were calculated. The diagnostic performance  of {ADC}, f and D as a measure for the differentiation between healthy pancreas and pancreatic carcinoma was evaluated with receiver operating characteristics analysis. {RESULTS:} In the healthy control group, the {ADC(tot)} ranged from 1.53 to 2.01 microm2/ms with a mean value of 1.71 +/- 0.19 microm2/ms, the perfusion fraction f ranged from 18.5\% to 40.4\% with a mean value of 25.0 +/- 6.2\%, and the diffusion coefficient D from 0.94 to 1.28 microm2/ms with a mean value of 1.13 +/- 0.15 microm2/ms. In patients with pancreas carcinoma, the {ADC(tot)} ranged from 0.98 to 1.81 microm2/ms with a mean value of 1.31 +/- 0.24 microm2/ms, the perfusion fraction f ranged from 0\% to 20.4\% with a mean value of 8.59 +/- 4.6\% and the diffusion coefficient D from 0.74 to 1.60 microm2/ms with a mean value of 1.15 +/- 0.22 microm2/ms. In comparison to healthy pancreatic tissue, a significant reduction of the perfusion fraction f and of {ADC(tot)} was found in pancreatic carcinoma (P {\textless} 0.00001, 0.0002, respectively). The f value showed more than a 10-fold higher significance level in distinguishing cancerous from normal  tissue when compared with the {ADC(tot)} value. No significant difference in the diffusion coefficient D was observed between the 2 groups (P {\textgreater} 0.5). In the receiver operating characteristic-analyses, the area under curve for f was 0.991  and significantly larger than {ADC(tot)} (P {\textless} 0.05). f had the highest sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and positive predictive value with 95.7\%, 100\%, 93.3\%, and 100\%, respectively. {CONCLUSIONS:} Using the {IVIM-approach}, the f  value proved to be the best parameter for the differentiation between healthy pancreas and pancreatic cancer. The acquisition of several b-values strongly improved the stability of the parameter estimation thus increasing the sensitivity and specificity to 95.7\% and 100\% respectively. The proposed method may hold great promise for the non invasive, noncontrast-enhanced imaging of pancreas lesions and may eventually become a screening tool for pancreatic cancer.},

Preliminary data suggest a significant influence of {FDG-PET/CT} on treatment planning, although its role is still evolving. {METHODS:} Thirty-eight consecutive patients with suspicion of pancreatic malignancy were enrolled. Patients underwent a protocol including {FDG-PET/CT}, {MDCT}, and {MRI} combined with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, all of which were blindly evaluated. The findings were confirmed macroscopically at operation and/or by histopathologic analysis (n = 29) or follow-up (n = 9). Results of {TNM} classification of different imaging methods were compared with clinical {TNM} classification. {RESULTS:} Pancreatic adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 17 patients,  neuroendocrine tumor in 3, mass-forming pancreatitis in 4, cystic lesion in 6, and fibrosis in 2. Six patients had a finding of a normal pancreas. The diagnostic accuracy of {FDG-PET/CT} for pancreatic malignancy was 89\%, compared with 76\% and 79\% for {MDCT} and {MRI}, respectively. In the differential diagnosis of suspected malignant biliary stricture at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (n = 21), {FDG-PET/CT} had a positive predictive value of 92\%. In 17 patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, {FDG-PET/CT} had a  sensitivity of 30\% for N- and 88\% for M-staging. Both {MDCT} and {MRI} had sensitivities of 30\% for N- and 38\% for M-staging. Furthermore, the clinical management of 10 patients (26\%) was altered after {FDG-PET/CT.} {CONCLUSION:}},

In this study, we characterized pancreatic tumor motion and evaluated the application of several radiotherapy motion management strategies. {METHODS} {AND} {MATERIALS:} Seventeen patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer were enrolled in a prospective internal review board-approved study and imaged during shallow free-breathing using cine {MRI} on a {3T} scanner. Tumor borders were agreed on by a radiation oncologist and an abdominal {MRI} radiologist. Tumor motion and correlation with the potential surrogates of the diaphragm and abdominal wall were assessed. These data were also used to evaluate planning target volume margin construction, respiratory gating, and four-dimensional treatment planning for pancreatic tumors. {RESULTS:} Tumor borders moved much more than expected. To provide 99\% geometric coverage, margins of 20 mm inferiorly, 10 mm anteriorly, 7 mm superiorly, and 4 mm posteriorly are required. Tumor position correlated poorly with diaphragm and abdominal wall position, with patient-level Pearson correlation coefficients of -0.18-0.43. Sensitivity and specificity of gating with these surrogates was also poor, at 53\%-68\%, with overall error of 35\%-38\%, suggesting that the tumor may be underdosed and normal tissues overdosed. {CONCLUSIONS:} Motion of pancreatic tumor  borders is highly variable between patients and larger than expected. There is substantial deformation with breathing, and tumor border position does not correlate well with abdominal wall or diaphragmatic position.

Three minutes after intravenous administration of secretin, post-contrast computed tomography scans were performed 40, 80, and 180 s after contrast medium  injection. {MR} protocol included axial/coronal, thin/thick-slab, single-shot T2 w  sequences and axial/coronal T1 w breath-hold spoiled gradient-echo images before  and 30-40 min after intravenous infusion of manganese dipyri-doxal diphosphate. Different observers blindly evaluated the ability of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging to characterize focal pancreatic lesions.

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most difficult neoplasms for early diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances of imaging including {3D} volume data setting in multidetector-row {CT} ({MDCT)} and {MRI} are urging us to focus on the imaging of normal and pathological conditions of pancreatic parenchyme and peripancreatic structures, which are frequently involved by pancreatic cancers and are affecting the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancers. In this Feature Section, five  main topics of pancreatic imaging are addressed: pancreatic arterial territories, imaging of the intra- and peripancreatic venous anatomy and its clinical significance, imaging of the peripancreatic lymphatic network and its clinical significance for staging of pancreatic cancer, perfusion characteristics of pancreatic cancer to differentiate chronic mass-forming pancreatitis, and development of intraductal papillary mucinus neoplasms of the pancreas ({IPMNs)} to adenocarcinoma and pancreatic invasion. Recognition and understanding of the imaging anatomy of the pancreas might lead to precise staging of pancreatic cancer and to new approaches of less-invasive treatment. Follow-up of patients with {IPMNs} of the pancreas on imaging seems, at this time, to be the most valuable strategy in the high-risk group selection.},

The relationship of extrapancreatic neural plexus invasion to these findings was analyzed. {RESULTS:} Signs of extrapancreatic neural plexus invasion were depicted on {MR} imaging in 80\% of patients, which included streaky and strand-like signal intensity structure in fat tissue in 50\% of patients and irregular masses adjacent to tumor in 30\%.

	doi = {10.1093/jnci/djt292},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Few studies have examined trends in pancreatic cancer death rates in the United States, and there have been no studies examining recent trends using age-period-cohort analysis.
{METHODS:} Annual percentage change in pancreatic cancer death rates was calculated for 1970 to 2009 by sex and race among adults aged 35 to 84 years using {US} mortality data provided by the National Center for Health Statistics and Joinpoint Regression. Age-period-cohort modeling was performed to evaluate the changes in cohort and period effects. All statistical tests were two-sided.
{RESULTS:} In white men, pancreatic cancer death rates decreased by 0.7\% per year from 1970 to 1995 and then increased by 0.4\% per year through 2009. Among white women, rates increased slightly from 1970 to 1984, stabilized until the late 1990s, then increased by 0.5\% per year through 2009. In contrast, the rates among blacks increased between 1970 and the late 1980s (women) or early 1990s (men) and then decreased thereafter. Age-period-cohort analysis showed that pancreatic cancer death risk was highest for the 1900 to 1910 birth cohort in men and the 1920 to 1930 birth cohort in women and there was a statistically significant increase in period effects since the late 1990s in both white men and white women (two-sided Wald test, P {\textless} .001).
{CONCLUSIONS:} In the United States, whites and blacks experienced opposite trends in pancreatic cancer death rates between 1970 and 2009 that are largely unexplainable by known risk factors. This study underscores the needs for urgent action to curb the increasing trends of pancreatic cancer in whites and for better understanding of the etiology of this disease.},

Intraoperative ultrasound is used especially in hepato-bilio-pancreatic tract interventions, given its diagnostic and therapeutic values. Between 2009-2012 in the {IOB} First Surgery Clinic 57 intraoperative echo graphies were performed, in patients with hepato-bilio-pancreatic pathologies, leading to intraoperative guided punctures with diagnostic or therapeutic purpose (in case of hepatic abscesses),detection of new hepatic metastases, their ablation under ultrasound guidance, exploration of the local-regional topography with the aim of an optimal hepatic resection. Intraoperative ultrasound allowed radioablation under echographic guidance in 43 patients, the majority presenting multiple hepatic metastases in different areas, this method also enabling control over complete lesional destruction. Also, in 11 cases (22.915), a number of hepatic 20 metastases which had not been visible on preoperative imaging scans were detected, and afterwards treated through {RFA;} also, in 14 cases intraoperative echography revealed the presence and nature of the hepatic tumours, leading to a correct histopathological diagnostic and an adequate therapy. The method was useful in pancreatic pathologies as well, in complicated forms of acute or chronic pancreatitis, tracking the Wirsung duct within the scleral and calcified mass of pancreatic tissue, through an ultrasound guided puncture, as well as in locating pancreatic cystic masses,determining the optimal puncture or pericystic-digestive drainage areas. Intraoperative ultrasound is an inexpensive, easy method, which allows real time exploration throughout the entire surgical process of hepato-bilio-pancreatic lesions, aiding the surgeon in modifying decisions regarding the intervention and preventing complications.},

The leading symptom in patients with pancreatic cancer is the pain. The pain can be related with neoplasms and their metastasis. We should use all kind of resourses for pain relief: conventional drugs (according to the three steps strategy of {WHO)}, interventional or surgical procedures.
{AIM:} To present the interventional and surgical techniques in our practice and to share our experience for pain control in patients with nonresectable pancreatic cancer to improve their quality of life.
{MATERIAL:} In a seven year period (2004-2011) we performed 59 thoracoscopic splanhnicectomies/30--bilateral/ 4 intraoperative resections of celiac ganglion, 25 {CT--control} celiac plexus neurolysis and 90 cases pain relief with epidural analgesia. Concerning the quality of life we applied a questionnaire of a spannish medical center " City of Hope" adapted for patients with cancer and the level of pain with visual analogue scale {VAS.}
{RESULTS:} The long-term duration of the pain relief technique depends on applied technic, of cancer invasion and of the technic itself. The technique with the longest effect are the intraoperative celiac ganglion removal and the bilateral thoracoscopic splanhnicectomy. On the other hand the shortest effect we report the celiac plexus neurolysis, and the epudural analgesia. These data are in correlation with the reduction of the pain shown using {VAS} thus improving the quality of life.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The surgical and interventional methods for control of cancer pain have their own collocation improving the quality of life of these patients. New strategies for the pain control are need in the future.},

This procedure has the potential to reduce the load of another tissue sampling in cases of pancreatic head cancer ({PHC)} with biliary stricture. The aim of this study is to identify factors associated with a positive outcome using {TBB} for {PHC.}
{METHODS:} In total, 130 cases that underwent {TBB} for investigation of distal biliary stricture were included [62 cases of {PHC}, 36 cases of distal biliary cancer ({DBC)}, and 32 cases of benign biliary stricture ({BBS)].} Factors affecting the diagnostic efficiency of {TBB} were determined using univariate and multivariate logistic analyses.
{RESULTS:} Cancer tissue was obtained in 31 cases (50\%) of {PHC} and 33 cases (91.7\%) of {DBC.} Multivariable analysis showed that ≧10 mg/dl of serum bilirubin level (odds ratio [{OR]:} 5.58; 95\% confidence interval [{CI]:} 1.29-28.20; P = 0.021) and ≧3 tissue samplings ({OR:} 3.59; 95\% {CI:} 1.02-14.27, P = 0.046) were independent factors affecting cancer-positive rate in cases of {PHC.} In {\textgreater}90\% of resected cases of {PHC}, cancer involved the left side of the biliary mucosa and the range of cancer invasion (≧2/3 of circumference of biliary mucosa) was also a significant factor (P = 0.001).
{CONCLUSIONS:} {PHC} showing high level of serum bilirubin ({\textgreater}10 mg/dl) and high circumferential proportion of bile duct invasion ({\textgreater}2/3 judging from {MDCT)} is a good indication for biliary biopsy.

Imaging plays a central role in the management of oncology patients including the initial diagnosis, staging, and follow-up to assess treatment response. Historically, radiologists have relied on free-style dictations to convey the results of imaging findings in radiology reports to referring clinicians. These unstructured free-style dictations can potentially be a source of frustration as the pertinent information needed to guide treatment may be omitted or difficult to extract from the report, thereby limiting its completeness and usefulness. These limitations can be overcome by adopting a structured and reproducible form of reporting imaging studies to help clinicians in deciding the best treatment strategy for each patient. There is a growing need to establish standardized radiology reporting templates for specific disease processes. One such example involves patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, as imaging findings determine the treatment arm to which the patient is assigned.

The objective of the current study was to measure the impact of {ROSE} service on the incidence of repeat {EUS} {FNA} biopsy procedures.
{METHODS:} Over a consecutive 3-year period, the pathology database at Washington University Medical Center was searched for patients with both an initial and subsequent {EUS} {FNA} biopsy demonstrating a solid lesion of the pancreas. These were divided temporally between the time before and after the introduction of {ROSE} service. Reports were reviewed and results were recorded.
{RESULTS:} A total of 379 patients underwent {ROSE} service and 377 patients did not. The percentage of repeat non-{ROSE} {EUS} {FNA} cases was 5.8\% and the percentage of repeat {ROSE} {EUS} {FNA} cases was 2.9\%. The use of the {ROSE} service was found to decrease the number of repeat procedures by approximately 50\% (P = .024).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Dietary pattern analyses characterizing combinations of food intakes offer conceptual and statistical advantages over food- and nutrient-based analyses of disease risk. However, few studies have examined dietary patterns and pancreatic cancer risk and none focused on the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. We used the Healthy Eating Index 2005 ({HEI-2005)} to estimate the association between meeting those dietary guidelines and pancreatic cancer risk.
{METHODS:} We calculated the {HEI-2005} score for 537 218 men and women in the National Institutes of Health-American Association of Retired Persons Diet and Health Study using responses to food frequency questionnaires returned in 1995 and 1996. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios ({HRs)} and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs)} for risk of pancreatic cancer according to {HEI-2005} quintiles and explored effect modification by known risk factors. P interaction values were calculated using the Wald test. All statistical tests were two-sided.
{RESULTS:} We identified 2383 incident, exocrine pancreatic cancer cases (median = 10.5 years follow-up). Comparing participants who met the most dietary guidelines (Q5) with those who met the fewest guidelines (Q1), we observed a reduced risk of pancreatic cancer ({HR} = 0.85, 95\% {CI} = 0.74 to 0.97). Among men there was an interaction by body mass index (P interaction = .03), with a hazard ratio of 0.72 (95\% {CI} = 0.59 to 0.88) comparing Q5 vs Q1 in overweight/obese men (body mass index ≥ 25 kg/m(2)) but no association among normal weight men.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Our findings support the hypothesis that consuming a high-quality diet, as scored by the {HEI-2005}, may reduce the risk of pancreatic cancer.},

{METHODS:} Data on demographics, biometrics, toxicity and survival were collected for the last 100 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation for locally advanced pancreatic cancer at our department (45.0 Gy and boost up to 54.0 Gy plus concurrent and subsequent gemcitabine), and the subcutaneous fat area at the umbilicus level was measured by computer tomography before and after chemoradiation.
{RESULTS:} After chemoradiation, patients showed a highly statistically significant weight loss and reduction of the subcutaneous fat area. We could determine a very strong correlation of subcutaneous fat area to patient {BMI.} By categorizing patients according to their {BMI} based on the {WHO} classification as slender, normal, overweight and obese, we found improved but not statistically significant survival among obese patients. Accordingly, patients who showed less weight loss tended to survive longer.
{CONCLUSIONS:} In this study, patients with pancreatic cancer lost weight during chemoradiation and their subcutaneous fat diminished. Changes in subcutaneous fat area were highly correlated with patients' {BMI.} Moreover, obese patients and patients who lost less weight had an improved outcome after treatment. Although the extent of weight loss was not significantly correlated with survival, the observed trend warrants greater attention to nutritional status in the future.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Ectopic pancreas can frequently be mistaken for other submucosal masses. Ectopic pancreas may follow the signal intensity of mother pancreas on various magnetic resonance ({MR)} sequences, which might be helpful for differentiation between ectopic pancreas and other submucosal tumors in upper gastrointestinal ({UGI)} tract.
{PURPOSE:} To evaluate the value of {MR} imaging ({MRI)} in differentiating ectopic pancreases from submucosal tumors in {UGI} tract.
{MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS:} Fifteen patients with ectopic pancreas and 26 patients with {UGI} submucosal tumors were included. All patients underwent abdominal {MRI} with diffusion-weighted imaging ({DWI)} and gadoxetic acid-enhanced {MRI.} Qualitative (location, contour, growth pattern, lesion border, and presence of intralesional cystic portion and duct-like structure) and quantitative (long diameter [{LD]}, short diameter [{SD]}, {LD/SD} ratio, signal intensities and apparent diffusion coefficients [{ADC]}, and signal intensity - and {ADC} ratios of {UGI} submucosal lesions to pancreas) parameters were compared between ectopic pancreases and {UGI} submucosal tumors using Fisher's exact test, the Mann-Whitney U test, and receiver-operating characteristic ({ROC)} analysis.
{RESULTS:} Duodenum was the most common location for ectopic pancreas (12/15, 79.9\%), and the gastric body for {UGI} submucosal tumors (15/26, 57.7\%) (P = 0.005). Round shape was an imaging feature more common in {UGI} submucosal tumors (12/26, 46.2\%) than in ectopic pancreas (1/15, 6.7\%; P = 0.021). On all of the various pulse sequences of {MR} images, ectopic pancreas showed isointensity comparable to that of pancreas more frequently than did sequences of {UGI} submucosal tumors (P {\textless} {0.01).The} means (0.95 ± 0.09, 0.99 ± 0.06, 1.07 ± 0.08) of the signal intensity ratio of ectopic pancreas to pancreas on fat-suppressed unenhanced T1-weighted, arterial, and portal phase images were significantly higher than those (0.60 ± 0.09, 0.62 ± 0.28, 0.86 ± 0.27) of {UGI} submucosal tumors (P {\textless} 0.05). In contrast, the means (1.05 ± 0.12, 0.93 ± 0.18) of the signal intensity ratios of ectopic pancreas on T2-weighted images and {DW} images (b = 800 s/mm(2)) were significantly lower than those (1.82 ± 0.39, 2.35 ± 0.94) of {UGI} submucosal tumors (P {\textless} 0.001). On {ROC} analysis, if absolute value of difference between 1.0 and signal intensity ratio of submucosal lesions to the pancreas on T1-weighted images is {\textless}0.21, the sensitivity and specificity reach 100.0\% for diagnosis ectopic pancreas from submucosal tumors.
{CONCLUSION:} Abdominal {MRI} with {DWI} can be a valuable tool for differentiating ectopic pancreases from {UGI} submucosal tumors.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT:} We compared the accuracy of fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-{CT} ({FDG-PET-CT)}, multi-detector computed tomography ({MDCT)} and {CA} 19-9 levels in detecting pancreatic cancer recurrence in patients with resected {CA} 19-9 positive pancreatic adenocarcinomas.
{METHODS:} We retrospectively evaluated 122 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas who underwent surgical resection of the tumor between January 2002 and December 2011. Twenty-five patients had {MDCT}, {FDG-PET-CT} and {CA} 19-9 levels performed no less than six weeks post-operation and within 8 weeks of each other for detection of tumor recurrence. Of these, 20 patients had high pre-operative {CA} 19-9 levels that dropped to a normal level postoperatively which will be the focus of this study. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value ({PPV}, {NPV)}, and accuracy of {MDCT}, {FDG-PET-CT}, and {CA} 19-9 in detecting recurrence were compared.
{RESULTS:} Operations performed included pyloric sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy (n=9), pancreaticoduodenectomy (n=7), distal pancreatectomy (n=3) and total pancreatectomy (n=1). Three patients had no recurrence, but local recurrence and distant metastasis were seen in 8 (40\%) and 12 (60\%) patients, respectively. In our study, sensitivity, specificity, {PPV}, {NPV} and diagnostic effectiveness (accuracy) were: 82\%, 100\%, 100\%, 50\%, 85\% for {MDCT;} 82\%, 100\%, 100\%, 50\%, 85\% for {FDG-PET-CT} and 94\%, 100\%, 100\%, 75\%, 95\% for {CA} 19-9. The difference in recurrence detection accuracy of the tests was not statistically significant. A combination of {CA} 19-9 with {MDCT} or {FDG-PET-CT} was 100\% accurate in detecting cancer recurrence in our patients.
{CONCLUSION:} Our data suggests that {CA} 19-9 levels can be used reliably to detect recurrent pancreatic adenocarcinomas in patients with {CA} 19-9-positive primary tumors. Combination of {CA} 19-9 with {MDCT} or {FDG-PET-CT} is potentially the most accurate approach in detecting pancreatic cancer recurrence.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} Pancreatic involvement in neuroblastoma is extremely rare, with few cases reported in the literature. We present imaging findings of pancreatic involvement in neuroblastoma with clinical and pathologic correlation in the largest documented series to date.
{SUBJECTS} {AND} {METHODS:} We prospectively reported pancreatic involvement evident on multimodality imaging in neuroblastoma patients presenting to our institution from 1997 to 2011. Lesions were classified according to location within the pancreas, and imaging features were correlated with cytogenetic and surgicopathologic findings.
{RESULTS:} Neuroblastoma involving the pancreas was evident on imaging of seven of 1031 patients (mean age, 6.6 years). One patient had pancreatic involvement at presentation, and six developed pancreatic disease at relapse or disease progression. Pancreatic lesions were most frequently initially identified on concurrent {CT} and ({123)I-metaiodobenzylguanidine} scintigraphy, and additional lesions initially were found on {MRI} and ultrasound. Five of seven patients had focal lesions, one had diffuse pancreatic involvement, and one had pancreatic extension from contiguous disease. The distribution of lesions favored the pancreatic body and tail. All patients had International Neuroblastoma Staging System stage 3 or 4 disease, Children's Oncology Group intermediate- or high-risk disease, and unfavorable histology at initial diagnosis. For the five patients with surgical correlation, pancreatic surgical specimens revealed neuroblastoma in three cases and ganglioneuroblastoma in two cases.
{CONCLUSION:} Although rare, pancreatic involvement in neuroblastoma occurs. Its variable imaging appearance should be considered when evaluating the retroperitoneum in patients with known or suspected neuroblastoma, particularly because increased patient survival holds the potential for uncommon patterns of recurrence.},

	abstract = {{AIMS:} Pancreatic cancer ({PC)} is a heterogeneous disease in terms of histological and molecular subtypes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of different histological subtypes on cancer-specific survival ({CSS)} in a large single-centre Middle European cohort.
{METHODS:} We retrospectively studied the records of 400 consecutive {PC} patients who were treated from 2004 to 2010 at a single tertiary academic centre. The association of histological subtypes and parameters such as tumour stage, tumour grade, levels of tumour markers carcinoembryonic antigen and {CA19-9} at diagnosis, was studied. {CSS} was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the influence of each parameter on {CSS} was assessed with univariate and multivariable Cox proportional models.
{RESULTS:} The survival time was significantly shorter in the ductal adenocarcinoma and acinar histological subtypes compared to neuroendocrine differentiation (p{\textless}0.001). No survival difference was observed between ductal adenocarcinomas and patients with a histological variant of ductal adenocarcinoma, namely, mucinous non-cystic adenocarcinoma (p=0.7). In multivariable analysis, ductal adenocarcinoma ({HR=3.1}, {CI} 1.6 to 6.1, p=0.001) and acinar carcinoma ({HR=3.2}, {CI} 1.3 to 8.5, p=0.016) were identified as independent predictors for {CSS.}
{CONCLUSIONS:} Our findings suggest that the main histological subtype is an independent predictor of {CSS} in patients with {PC.} Thus, our data underline the importance of routine assessment of histological type in {PC} for individual risk assessment. However, no clinical rationale for the subdivision of ductal adenocarcinoma and mucinous non-cystic adenocarcinoma can be supported by our study.},

{METHOD:} Ninety patients with solid pancreatic focal lesions were enrolled, including 36 cases of pancreatic carcinoma, 28 cases of pancreatitis, 6 cases of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor, 12 cases of solid pseudopapillary tumor of the pancreas, 6 cases of pancreatic metastases, 1 case of cavernous hemolymphangioma and 1 case of lymphoma. {US} and {CEUS} were applied respectively for the diagnosis of a total of 90 cases of solid pancreatic lesions. The diagnostic results were scored on a 5-point scale. Results of {CEUS} were compared with {CECT.}
{RESULTS:} (1) 3-score cases (undetermined) diagnosed by {CEUS} were obviously fewer than that of {US}, while the number of 1-score (definitely benign) and 5-score (definitely malignant) cases diagnosed by {CEUS} was significantly more than that of {US.} There was a significant difference in the distribution of final scores using the two methods (p{\textless}0.001).

(2) The diagnostic consistency among three ultrasound doctors: the kappa values calculated for {US} were 0.537, 0.444 and 0.525, compared with 0.748, 0.645 and 0.795 for {CEUS.} The interobserver agreement for {CEUS} was higher than that for {US.} (3) The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma with {CEUS} and {CECT} were 91.7\% and 97.2\%, 87.0\% and 88.9\%, and 88.9\% and 92.2\%, respectively, while for the diagnosis of pancreatitis, the corresponding indices were 82.1\% and 67.9\%, 91.9\% and 100\%, and 88.9\% and 90\%, respectively, showing no significant differences (p{\textgreater}0.05).

	abstract = {The correlation between the pancreatic and external abdominal motion due to respiration was investigated on two patients. These studies utilized four dimensional computer tomography ({4D} {CT)}, a four dimensional ({4D)} electromagnetic transponder system, and a gating belt system. One {4D} {CT} study was performed during simulation to quantify the pancreatic motion using computer tomography images at eight breathing phases. The motion under free breathing and breath-hold were analyzed for the {4D} electromagnetic transponder system and the gating belt system during treatment. A linear curve was fitted for all data sets and correlation factors were evaluated between the {4D} electromagnetic transponder system and the gating belt system data. The {4D} {CT} study demonstrated a modest correlation between the external marker and the pancreatic motion with R-square values larger than 0.8 for the inferior-superior (inf-sup). Then, the relative pressure from the belt gating system correlated well with the {4D} electromagnetic transponder system's motion in the anterior-posterior (ant-post) and the inf-post directions. These directions have a correlation value of -0.93 and 0.76, while the lateral only had a 0.03 correlation coefficient. Based on our limited study, external surrogates can be used as predictors of the pancreatic motion in the inf-sup and the ant-post directions. Although there is a low correlation on the lateral direction, its motion is significantly shorter. In conclusion, an appropriate treatment delivery can be used for pancreatic cancer when an internal tracking system, such as the {4D} electromagnetic transponder system, is unavailable.},

{INTERVENTION:} {EUS} with {FNA.}
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} Diagnostic yield of malignancy and significance of clinical variables.
{RESULTS:} When surgical pathology or subsequent clinical course was used as the criterion standard, {EUS} with {FNA} had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy of 87.3\%, 98.3\%, 98.5\%, and 92.1\%, respectively, in diagnosing a pancreatic neoplasm that was indeterminate on {MDCT.} Factors significantly associated with {EUS} detection of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were total bilirubin level greater than 2 {mg/dL} (P {\textless} .001), {CT} finding of pancreatic duct dilation (P {\textless} .001), bile duct stricture (P {\textless} .001), and tumor size 1.5 cm or larger detected by {EUS} (P = .004).

Among pancreatic cancers with low (Ki-67{\textless}5\%), moderate (5\% ≤ Ki-67{\textless}50\%), and high (Ki-67 ≥ 50\%) {PI}, {SUV(max)} increased significantly from 4.2 ± 1.2, through 6.0 ± 1.7, to 8.6 ± 2.5 (P{\textless}0.001). The {SUV(max)} had a positive correlation with Ki-67 {PI} (P{\textless}0.001, r=0.60).
{CONCLUSION:} The {SUV(max)} of F-{FDG} {PET/CT} can be used in the differential diagnosis of solitary pancreatic lesions and can also aid in the prediction of proliferative activity of pancreatic cancer.},

Real-time sonographic images were taken, and vital signs, liver and kidney function, skin burns, local reactions, and systemic effects were monitored and recorded before, during, and after {HIFU.} Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} was also performed before and after {HIFU.}
{RESULTS:} Serum amylase level increased in 16 cases (7.1\%) 1 day after {HIFU} treatment, and 9 of these cases also had abnormal urinary amylase levels. Gastrointestinal ({GI)} dysfunction such as abdominal distension and anorexia with slight nausea was observed in 10 cases (4.5\%) after {HIFU} treatment. 1 case with pancreatic head cancer developed obstructive jaundice 2 weeks after {HIFU} treatment. Vertebral injury, identified by {MRI}, occurred in 2 cases, although no symptoms were seen. No severe complications such as skin burns, lesion bleeding, {GI} tract bleeding or {GI} perforation were observed in any of the cases.

A central role in pancreatic cancer progression has been suggested for tissue factor ({TF)}, the main initiator of the blood coagulation cascade. We hypothesized that elevated levels of plasma microparticle ({MP)-associated} {TF} activity might indicate the presence of poorly differentiated pancreatic cancer, disease dissemination and infiltration of peripancreatic vessels.
{METHODS:} {MP-TF} activity was measured in 73 pancreatic cancer patients and 22 healthy controls. Abdominal computerized tomography ({CT)} scans performed at study inclusion were investigated for probability of tumoural vascular invasion. In addition, intratumoural {TF} expression, D-dimer and {CA} 19-9 levels were determined.
{RESULTS:} {MP-TF} activity ({pg/mL)} was significantly higher in patients (median: 0·37 [range: 0·00-11·91]) than in controls (median: 0·05 [range: 0·00-0·76]; P {\textless} 0·001). When pancreatic cancer patients were compared with regard to stage and grade, significantly elevated levels of {MP-TF} activity were only present in those with poorly differentiated metastatic nonresectable tumours (n = 11, median: 2·95 [range: 0·25-11·91]). In three patients with poorly differentiated tumours, a high probability of vascular invasion was found ({MP-TF} activity in these cases: 2·95, 7·00 and 10·34). {MP-TF} activity correlated strongly with {CA} 19-9 (r = 0·60) and weakly with D-dimer (r = 0·33) levels. Immunohistochemical staining for {TF} was positive in 14 of 15 resected tumours. {MP-TF} activity was associated with an increased risk of mortality ({HR:} 1·8 per doubling in {MP-TF} activity, [95\% {CI:} 1·4-2·4, P {\textless} 0·001]).

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Clinical and {CT} imaging records of ten patients with pancreatic acinar cell carcinoma (three women and seven men; mean age, 58 years) examined using multidetector {CT} scanners were retrospectively studied. {CT} features emphasised included lesion location, size, shape, margin, solid or cystic component, density and enhancement. Imaging results were correlated with intraoperative surgical and pathological results.
{RESULTS:} Lesions were distributed throughout the pancreatic head (n=3), body (n=3), tail (n=2) and both body and tail (n=2). The average diameter was 6.1 cm, varying from 2.3 cm to 15.8 cm. The tumours were round or oval (n=7) or lobular (n=3). Seven tumours appeared as enhanced solid pancreatic masses, with the large masses having hypodense areas; three had {\textgreater}75 \% cystic component; seven (70\%), including four solid and three cystic masses, had well-circumscribed or partially well-defined thin, enhanced encapsulation. After contrast injection, the masses presented heterogeneous enhancement.

Since the original compendium by Steinberg in 1990, numerous studies have reported the use of {CA} 19-9 and, to a lesser extent, {CEA} in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Here we update an evaluation of the accuracy of {CA} 19-9 and {CEA}, and, unlike previous reviews, focus on discrimination between malignant and benign disease instead of normal controls. In 57 studies involving 3,285 pancreatic carcinoma cases, the combined sensitivity of {CA} 19-9 was 78.2\% and in 37 studies involving 1,882 cases with benign pancreatic disease the specificity of {CA} 19-9 was 82.8\%. From the combined analysis of studies reporting {CEA}, the sensitivity was 44.2\% (1,324 cases) and the specificity was 84.8\% (656 cases). These measurements more appropriately reflect the expected biomarker accuracy in the differential diagnosis of patients with periampullary diseases.

{RESULTS:} {EUS-FNA} of pancreatic lesions was performed in 125 patients. Of these patients, data of 75 were available (69\% men, mean age 59.97±11.12 ({SD)} years); 58 (76\%) of the lesions were ductal adenocarcinoma, 11 (14.5\%) were chronic pancreatitis, 4 (\%5) were intraductal papillary mucinous carcinoma ({IPMN)} and 2 (\%3) were insulinoma.

Inoperable patients were excluded.
{RESULTS:} Patients with {CA19-9} {\textgreater}{150U/mL} had a frequency of surgical resection 11.7\% (14/120) vs. 34.5\% (30/87) in those patients with a lower level of {CA19-9} (p{\textless}0.001).

Effective early detection methods are needed since this is the best way to cure this disease.

Although several biomarkers have been proposed for pancreatic cancer detection, the clinical applicability has been confusing. Currently, although {CA19-9} is one test used, the sensitivity and specificity for the disease are less than optimal. Here, we review several new potential serum, plasma and stool markers that are currently under evaluation. Although these have not been sufficiently validated for routine clinical use, these markers could prove valuable with further investigations. We keep the hope that a combination of some of these novel biomarkers can be a useful tool for early {PDAC} diagnosis before image techniques and/or patient's symptoms reveal disease in an incurable state.},

	abstract = {We have evaluated the usefulness of contrast-enhanced ultrasound ({CEUS)} for diagnosing, staging and assessment of operability of pancreatic head tumors. For some years {CEUS} has been used with great success for diagnosis of focal liver lesions but when we started our trial, it was still relatively untested in the pancreas. This {PhD} thesis is based on a methodological study, two clinical studies and an intra-/interobserver study. The methodological study consists of material collected from investigations made on 14 experimental pigs. First, we examined the pig pancreas with {CEUS.} Hereafter we repeated the {CEUS} examination after venous injection of the gastrointestinal hormones secretin and cholecystokinin. We investigated if the contrast-enhancement would intensify after hormone stimulation. The clinical studies consist of material collected from examinations of 49 patients referred to our hospital with the diagnosis, suspicion of pancreatic cancer. All patients had a conventional ultrasound examination and a {CEUS} examination. In addition, some of the patients also had a {CEUS} examination after stimulation with secretin and cholecystokinin. All patients had a 64-slice-{CT} examination and a biopsy was taken for histopathological verification. We studied whether {CEUS} was useful for assessment of tumor classification, tumor staging and tumor resectability. We also tested if hormone stimulation of the pancreas during {CEUS} could intensify contrast-enhancement of healthy pancreatic tissue and thus contribute to a better demarcation of a tumor. Finally, we tested the intra-/interobserver agreement of our visual interpretation of the contrast-enhanced ultrasound images and the concordance between the visual interpretation and histopathological test results. From the results of the methodological study it seemed possible to intensify contrast-enhancement using the gastrointestinal hormones by 3\%. During the clinical studies it emerged that hormone stimulation did not improve the visual impression of the {CEUS} examinations in any cases. We found that {CEUS} may be a useful diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of pancreatic head tumors, with a sensitivity of 86\% ({CI:} 79-96) in the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinomas with histopathology as gold standard. Our intra-/interobserver agreements of the visual interpretation of tumor enhancement using {CEUS} showed substantial or almost perfect agreement with kappa values between 0.75 and 0.89. {CEUS} was useful for assessment of liver metastases but not as useful for assessment of the local tumor area and thereby not very useful for assessment of tumor resectability. By performing the {US+CEUS} and 64-{CT} we additionally found 35\% and 45\% respectively nonresectable patients of a group of patients, who were considered resectable on the primary radiological image material. In conclusion this thesis points to {CEUS} as a useful but not sufficient tool in the diagnosis, staging and assessment of operability of patients with pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {AIM:} Early detection and differentiation of malignant from benign pancreatic tumors is very essential as mass-forming pancreatitis is a frequently encountered problem. Positron emission tomography ({PET)} has a role in establishing the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma when the conventional imaging modalities or biopsies are nondiagnostic. In this prospective study, the utility of fluorodeoxyglucose ({FDG)-PET/computed} tomography ({CT)} in the characterization of mass-forming lesions of the pancreas was reported.
{METHODS:} ({18)F-FDG-PET/CT} was prospectively performed in 87 patients diagnosed to have periampullary or pancreatic mass. Lesions with focally increased {FDG} uptake in {PET/CT} were considered malignant, whereas those with diffuse or no {FDG} uptake were considered benign. Semiquantitative analysis with maximum standardized uptake value ({SUVmax)} was also calculated. The {PET/CT} results were compared with histopathological results in all patients.
{RESULTS:} Based on the {FDG} uptake pattern, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for {FDG-PET/CT} in characterizing the periampullary and pancreatic masses into benign and malignant lesions were 93\%, 90\%, 95\%, 87\%, and 92\% respectively. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis of the {SUVmax} of the lesions yielded a cut-off value of 2.8, with a sensitivity and specificity of 87.5\% and 45\% respectively.
{CONCLUSION:} The {FDG} uptake pattern in {PET/CT} can differentiate malignant from benign mass-forming lesions of the pancreas with high accuracy and a discrete cut-off value of {SUVmax} could not be defined for the same as even lesions with pancreatic tuberculosis showed very high {FDG} uptake. Hence, in patients with a suspicion of malignancy in the pancreas, a focally increase {FDG} uptake in {PET/CT} suggests the diagnosis of malignancy.},

{METHODS:} Sera were purified by Sep-Pak C18 before {MALDI-TOF/MS} Anchorchip analysis.
{RESULTS:} Features present in at least 5\% of all spectra were selected (n = 160, m/z range, 1200-5000).

Ten-fold cross-validation binary recursive partitioning trees were obtained for patients' classification. The tree ({CA} 19-9, age, m/z 2006, 2599, 2753, and 4997), built considering only patients with diabetes, allowed a distinction between {DM} [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({AUC)}, 0.997], chronic pancreatitis ({AUC}, 0.968), and {PaCa} ({AUC}, 0.980), with an overall correct classification rate of 89\%.

{METHODS:} Patients presenting for {EUS} were classified into the following 4 categories: (1) normal, (2) noncalcific chronic pancreatitis ({NCCP)}, (3) calcific {CP} ({CCP)}, and (4) {PC.}
{RESULTS:} There were 198 patients enrolled. Final diagnoses were {PC} (n = 34), {CCP} (n = 16), and {normal/NCCP} (n = 148). The median {PD} diameter (8, 5, and 2 mm, respectively; P = {\textless}0.001), G (16, 20, and 17 mm, respectively; P = 0.002), and {PDG} ratio were significantly different among groups (0.54, 0.25, and 0.12, respectively; P {\textless} 0.001). Patients with {PC} were more likely to have a {PDG} ratio of greater than or equal to 0.34 compared to {CCP}, and {normal/NCCP} groups (94\%, 19\%, 1.3\%, respectively; P {\textless} 0.001). The positive predictive value, negative predictive value, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of {PDG} greater than or equal to 0.34 for detecting cancer were 87\%, 99\%, 94\%, 97\%, and 97\%, respectively. The accuracy and positive predictive value of {PD} dilation alone for diagnosing {PC} were 83\% and 50\%, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS:} A {PDG} ratio is a good predictor of {PC} and is better than {PD} dilation. This sign should be routinely used by endosonographers to improve {EUS} diagnostic capability of {PC.}},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The adipocyte-secreted hormone adiponectin has insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory properties. Although development of pancreatic cancer is associated with states of insulin resistance and chronic inflammation, the mechanistic basis of the associations is poorly understood.
{METHODS:} To determine whether prediagnostic plasma levels of adiponectin are associated with risk of pancreatic cancer, we conducted a nested case-control study of 468 pancreatic cancer case subjects and 1080 matched control subjects from five prospective {US} cohorts: Health Professionals Follow-up Study, Nurses' Health Study, Physicians' Health Study, Women's Health Initiative, and Women's Health Study. Control subjects were matched to case subjects by prospective cohort, year of birth, smoking status, fasting status, and month of blood draw. All samples for plasma adiponectin were handled identically in a single batch. Odds ratios were calculated with conditional logistic regression, and linearity of the association between adiponectin and pancreatic cancer was modeled with restricted cubic spline regression. All statistical tests were two-sided.
{RESULTS:} Median plasma adiponectin was lower in case subjects versus control subjects (6.2 vs 6.8 {µg/mL}, P = .009). Plasma adiponectin was inversely associated with pancreatic cancer risk, which was consistent across the five prospective cohorts (P (heterogeneity) = .49) and independent of other markers of insulin resistance (eg, diabetes, body mass index, physical activity, plasma C-peptide). Compared with the lowest quintile of adiponectin, individuals in quintiles 2 to 5 had multivariable odds ratios ([{ORs]} 95\% confidence intervals [{CIs])} of {OR} = 0.61 (95\% {CI} = 0.43 to 0.86), {OR} = 0.58 (95\% {CI} = 0.41 to 0.84), {OR} = 0.59 (95\% {CI} = 0.40 to 0.87), and {OR} = 0.66 (95\% {CI} = 0.44 to 0.97), respectively (P (trend) = .04). Restricted cubic spline regression confirmed a nonlinear association (P (nonlinearity) {\textless} .01). The association was not modified by sex, smoking, body mass index, physical activity, or C-peptide (all P (interaction) {\textgreater} .10).
{CONCLUSIONS:} In this pooled analysis, low prediagnostic levels of circulating adiponectin were associated with an elevated risk of pancreatic cancer.},

The aim of this prospective pilot study is to analyze the hypoxia agent fluoromisonidazole ({FMISO)} using {PET/CT} in pancreatic carcinoma and to compare {FMISO} activity with glucose metabolism reflected by {FDG.}
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} Ten patients with pancreatic carcinoma underwent {FMISO} and {FDG} {PET} scans. {FMISO} and {FDG} {PET/CT} scans were analyzed by 2 {PET} physicians. Regions of interest drawn on the {FDG} images were transposed to the {FMISO} images after study coregistration. The {FDG} {SUVmax} was used to quantify metabolic activity and {FMISO} {SUVmax} and tumor-to-background (muscle) ratio to quantify hypoxia.
{RESULTS:} Seven patients were diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The remaining patients had a neuroendocrine tumor, poorly differentiated/sarcomatoid carcinoma, and mucinous neoplasm. Visual analysis demonstrated increased {FMISO} activity in 2 pancreatic adenocarcinomas. All patients, however, had increased {FDG} activity at the tumor site. Mean {FDG} {SUVmax} was 6 (range: 3.8 to 9.5) compared to 2.3 for {FMISO} (range: 1 to 3.4). The 2 positive studies on visual analysis of {FMISO} did not correspond to the largest tumors, the studies with the highest {FMISO} or {FDG} {SUVmax.} There was no significant correlation between {FMISO} and {FDG} {SUVmax} values.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The hypoxia imaging agent, {FMISO}, demonstrates minimal activity in pancreatic tumors. If {FMISO} {PET/CT} is to be included in clinical trial protocols of hypoxia in pancreatic cancer, it would require correlation with other imaging modalities to localize the tumor and allow semiquantitative analysis.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The purpose of this study is to report our initial experience with a new fully covered metallic stent with a novel design ({AXIOS)} to prevent migration and fluid leakage, in the drainage of pancreatic fluid collections ({PFC).}
{METHODS:} We included nine patients from four Spanish centers undergoing endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)-guided} drainage of {PFC} with placement of an {AXIOS} stent. The lesions were accessed via transgastric (n = 7), transesophageal (n = 1), and transduodenal (n = 1) by using a novel access device ({NAVIX)} in six cases or a 19-G needle in three. Patients were individually followed prospectively for procedure indications, demographic data, previous imaging techniques, technical aspects, clinical outcomes, complications, and follow-up after endoscopic drainage.
{RESULTS:} The mean size of lesions was 105 ± 26.3 mm (range, 70-150). In six cases, cystoscopy was performed through the stent, including necrosectomy in two. Median procedure time was 25 ± 13 min. A median number of two sessions were performed. The technical success rate was 88.8 \% (8/9) due to one failure of the delivery system. One patient developed a tension pneumothorax immediately after transesophageal drainage. No migrations were reported, and all stents were removed easily. All patients had a successful treatment outcome achieving complete cyst resolution. Mean time to stent retrieval was 33 ± 40 days. Mean follow-up was 50 ± 1.3 weeks (range, 45-55), and only one patient presented a recurrence 4 weeks after the stent removal. Furthermore, comparison with ten previous consecutively recruited {PFC} cases drained by {EUS-guided} using plastic pigtail stents was done. Technical and clinical successes were similar. However, two stent migrations, two recurrences, and two complications were found. The number of stents used (n = 15) and the median procedure time (42.8 ± 3.1 min) were significantly higher.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Drainage of {PFC} using dedicated devices as this novel metallic stent with special design seems to be an effective, feasible and safe alternative technique.},

{METHODS:} Demographic, clinical, {EUS}, pathological, clinical outcome, and follow-up data of patients who underwent {EUS} at our institution between October 1998 and March 2010 for a known or suspected pancreatic metastasis were abstracted.
{RESULTS:} Forty-nine patients (23 males; median age, 63 years; range 30-83 years) with 72 pancreatic masses were identified. Primary tumor sites included kidney (21), lung (8), skin (6), colon (4), breast (3), small bowel (2), stomach (2), liver (1), ovary (1), and bladder (1).

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Prior to clinical study, the phantom study was performed to evaluate the impact of respiratory motion on lesion quantification. Twenty-two patients (mean age 65 years) with pancreatic tumors were enrolled. Pathological diagnoses by surgical specimens consisted of pancreatic cancer (n=15) and benign intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ({IPMN}, n=7). Whole-body scan of non-respiratory-gated {PET/CT} was performed at first, and subsequent respiratory-gated {PET/CT} for one bed position was performed. All {PET/CT} studies were performed prior to surgery. The {SUV} max obtained by non-respiratory-gated {PET/CT} and respiratory-gated {PET/CT}, and percent difference in {SUVmax} ({\%SUVmax)} were compared.
{RESULTS:} The profile curve of 5 respiratory bin image was most similar to that of static image. The third bin of 5 respiratory bin image showed highest {FWHM} (24.0mm) and {FWTM} (32.7 mm). The mean {SUVmax} of pancreatic cancer was similar to that of benign {IPMN} on non-respiratory-gated {PET/CT} (p=0.05), whereas significant difference was found between two groups on respiratory-gated {PET/CT} (p=0.016). The mean {\%SUV} of pancreatic cancer was greater than that of benign {IPMN} (p{\textless}0.0001). Identification of the primary tumor in pancreatic head (n=13, 59\%) was improved by using respiratory-gated {PET/CT} because of minimal affection of physiological accumulation in duodenum.

For each tumor the {CEUS} and {CECT} features were analyzed and compared with the final histological diagnosis. {RESULTS.} Testing the performance of {CEUS} and {CECT} in evaluating the benign or malignant etiology of pancreatic masses, we obtained a probability of 82\% for {CEUS} and of 83\% for {CECT}, for a randomly selected individual from the pancreatic tumor group to have an imaging result indicating suspicion for malignancy. We obtained discordances with the histopathological diagnosis in 25 (32.89\%) patients for {CEUS} and in 23 (30.26\%) patients for {CECT.} In multiple regression analysis, two variables independently influenced the discordance between the two imaging methods and histological conclusion: enhancement pattern and tumor nature (solid vs. cystic). {CONCLUSIONS.CEUS} and {CECT} showed a good diagnostic performance in differentiating benign from malignant pancreatic tumors. Enhancement pattern and tumor nature (solid vs. cystic) are independent confounders between imaging and histological diagnosis.},

Surgery is the only potentially curative treatment even though the result is a palliation in the majority of cases and the majority of lesions are lately diagnosed. Progression from normal pancreatic epithelium to metastatic disease is now a well-characterized sequence of events. Research has shown that pancreatic cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease with several biological pathway implied in apoptosis, cell proliferation and self-sufficiency in growth signaling, but how those findings could be applied in daily clinical practice remain unknown. Several studies tried to characterize diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in {PDAC} to make it possible an earlier diagnosis, guarantee a more effective treatment and reach a better prognosis even though the results remain contrasting. The main limit of the published researches is the small number of patients studied, but even the heterogeneity of the used methods of analysis. Examining critically the research of the last years future trials may be addressed toward a translational models integrating "the bench and the bed" with the clinical experience and drive the basic research toward the clinical applications.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} To investigate the potential diagnostic value of dual-energy {CT} ({DECT)} with virtual non-enhanced ({VNE)} and iodine-only images, and to determine the optimal mixed ratio of blended images for evaluation of pancreatic diseases.
{METHODS:} Multiphasic {DECT} was performed in 44 patients with focal pancreatic disease. {DECT} was used during the pancreatic and hepatic venous phases, and a peak kilovoltage of 120 {kVp} was used for both non-contrast phases. For qualitative analysis of the {CT} images, two radiologists assessed three image sets ({VNE}, iodine-only and blended images) in order to determine the acceptability of {VNE} in replacing true non-enhanced ({TNE)} images, the added value of iodine-only images and the preferred blending ratio. For quantitative analyses, the {CT} numbers and image noise of the pancreatic parenchyma, lesions, aorta and psoas muscle were measured. The contrast-to-noise ratio of the lesion was calculated on the pancreatic phase images. The effective radiation dose for {DECT} and {TNE} images was calculated. Statistical comparisons were made using the Friedman test, the Wilcoxon test, the paired t-test and repeated measures of analysis of variation with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
{RESULTS:} The level of acceptance of the {VNE} images in replacing {TNE} images was 90.9\%. Regarding the iodine-only images, 50\% of the cases were found to have an added value. The linear-blended images with a weighting factor of 0.5 were preferred.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {DECT} was able to provide high-quality {VNE} images that could replace {TNE} images and iodine-only images showing an added value. Blended images with a weighting factor of 0.5 were preferred by the reviewers.},

{METHODS:} This was a retrospective review of the patients who had {EUS} assessment from September 2008 to December 2011 for suspicious pancreatic tumors. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the {ROC} curve to detect pancreatic malignancies were calculated and compared between the {ER-EUS} and {EC-EUS} cohort. The final diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy was based on pathology, or the consensus of patient's clinical course and multimodal imaging tests.
{RESULTS:} Two hundred twenty-one patients were included and divided into two cohorts: {ER-EUS} (n = 139) and {EC-EUS} (n = 82) cohorts. With propensity score matching method, 70 cases in each cohort were selected for the comparison.

The studied group included 57 patients (31 men, 26 women, mean age 65 ± 9 years). Blood was collected at the time of diagnosis of pancreas cancer and basic laboratory parameters, including nutritional and inflammatory markers and tumour markers were measured. Patients were followed up until death (median survival 147 days). Ferritin, iron, albumin, prealbumin, cholinesterase, haemoglobin, C-reactive protein, alkaline phosphatase and carcinoembryonic antigen were significant for patients' prognosis in univariate analysis while {CA} 19-9, bilirubin, liver, pancreas and kidney tests and lipids were not. Multivariate Cox regression demonstrated ferritin, iron and albumin as independent mortality predictors ({RR} ({95\%CI)}, per standard deviation: ferritin 1.497(1.215-2.241), p = 0.002; albumin, 0.716(0.521-0.977), p = 0.035; iron, 0.678(0.504-0.915), p = 0.010). Iron correlated significantly with albumin (r = 0.397, p = 0.002) but neither iron nor albumin correlated with ferritin. Patients who survived 100 days had significantly lower ferritin (median 239 μg/l vs. non-survivors 435 μg/l, p = 0.014), significantly higher albumin but the difference in serum iron was not quite significant. {ROC} analysis for ferritin revealed {AUC} for 100 days survival of 0.710, p = 0.007 (and 0.725, p = 0.004 for 200 days survival). {AUC} for albumin for 100 days survival was not significant (p = 0.073).

The detection of small pancreatic tumors which are still resectable is still a challenging {problem.The} aim of this study was to investigate the effect of decreasing the tube voltage from 120 to 80 {kV} on the detection of pancreatic tumors.
{METHODS:} Three scanning protocols was used; one using the standard tube voltage (120 {kV)} and current (160 {mA)} and two using 80 {kV} but with different tube currents (500 and 675 {mA)} to achieve equivalent dose (15 {mGy)} and noise (15 {HU)} as that of the standard {protocol.Tumors} were simulated into collected {CT} phantom images. The attenuation in normal parenchyma at 120 {kV} was set at 130 {HU}, as measured previously in clinical examinations, and the tumor attenuation was assumed to differ 20 {HU} and was set at {110HU.} By scanning and measuring of iodine solution with different concentrations the corresponding tumor and parenchyma attenuation at 80 {kV} was found to be 185 and 219 {HU}, {respectively.To} objectively evaluate the differences between the three protocols, a multi-reader multi-case receiver operating characteristic study was conducted, using three readers and 100 cases, each containing 0-3 lesions.
{RESULTS:} The highest reader averaged figure-of-merit ({FOM)} was achieved for 80 {kV} and 675 {mA} ({FOM=0},850), and the lowest for 120 {kV} ({FOM=0},709). There was a significant difference between the three protocols (p{\textless}0,0001), when making an analysis of variance ({ANOVA).} Post-hoc analysis (students t-test) shows that there was a significant difference between 120 and 80 {kV}, but not between the two levels of tube currents at 80 {kV.}
{CONCLUSION:} We conclude that when decreasing the tube voltage there is a significant improvement in tumor conspicuity.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} {EUS-guided} {FNA} is one of the few techniques that can obtain cells and tissue from the liver and pancreas. However, the technique remains vulnerable to poor specimen quality and sampling error.
{OBJECTIVE:} To evaluate the ability of a high-resolution microendoscope ({HRME)} to visualize the cellular and architectural features of normal and malignant liver and pancreatic tissue ex vivo, to assess the ability of endosonographers to identify normal and neoplastic tissue by using {HRME} images, and to demonstrate preliminary technical feasibility of in vivo {HRME} imaging via {EUS} fine-needle puncture ({FNP).}
{DESIGN:} Ex vivo pilot feasibility study in human tissue; in vivo swine model.
{SETTING:} Two academic medical centers.
{PATIENTS:} Co-registered {HRME} images and biopsies were obtained from surgically resected hepatic and pancreatic tissues from 44 patients.
{INTERVENTION:} Images were divided into training (12 images) and test (80 images) sets containing a range of normal and pathologic conditions for each organ. After viewing the training sets, 9 endosonographers attempted to distinguish malignant tissue from normal or benign lesions in the test sets, each of which contained 40 unique images with individual diagnoses from pathology.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} Image acquisition feasibility, ex vivo and in vivo. Ability of endosonographers to recognize features of normal/benign or malignant tissue from the liver and pancreas.
{RESULTS:} Overall, the 9 endosonographers achieved median accuracy figures of 85\% in the liver and 90\% in the pancreas. The endosonographers with prior experience in reading {HRME} images achieved accuracy rates between 90\% and 95\%. Technical feasibility of {HRME} imaging through a 19-gauge {EUS-FNP} needle was demonstrated in an in vivo swine model.
{LIMITATIONS:} Ex vivo study.
{CONCLUSION:} High-resolution microendoscopy allows real-time imaging of cellular-level morphology and tissue architecture in the liver and pancreas. The technique appears to have a short learning curve, after which endosonographers achieved high accuracy rates in distinguishing malignant tissue from normal and benign pathology in both organs. Translating this imaging platform to the in vivo setting appears technically feasible.},

{AIM:} To compare diagnostic yield of {EUS-FNA} in patients with or without biliary stents.
{DESIGN:} Retrospective study.
{SETTING:} Tertiary referral center.
{PATIENTS:} Patients with obstructive jaundice secondary to solid pancreatic mass lesions who underwent {EUS-FNA} over 5 years.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES:} The primary objective was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of {EUS-FNA} in patients with or without biliary stents and between patients with plastic stents or self-expandable metal stents ({SEMSs).} Secondary objectives were to assess the technical difficulty of {EUS-FNA} by comparing the number of passes required to establish diagnosis and to identify predictors of a false-negative diagnosis.
{RESULTS:} Of 214 patients who underwent {EUS-FNA}, 150 (70\%) had biliary stents and 64 (30\%) had no stents in place. Of 150 patients with biliary stents, 105 (70\%) were plastic and 45 (30\%) were {SEMSs.} At {EUS-FNA}, the diagnosis was pancreatic cancer in 155 (72\%), chronic pancreatitis in 17 (8\%), other cancer in 31 (14\%), and indeterminate in 11 (5\%). There was no difference in rates of diagnostic accuracy between patients with or without stents (93.7\% vs 95.3\%; P = .73) and between plastic or {SEMSs} (95.2\% vs 95.5\%, P = .99), respectively. Median number of passes to diagnosis was not significantly different between patients with or without stents (2 [interquartile ratio range ({IQR)} = 1-3] vs 2 [{IQR} = 1-4]; P = .066) and between plastic or {SEMS} (2.5 [{IQR} = 1-4] vs 2 [{IQR} = 1-4], P = .69), respectively. On univariate analysis, {EUS-FNA} results were false-negative in patients with large pancreatic masses ({\textgreater}3 cm vs {\textless}3 cm, 9.35\% vs 0.93\%, P = .005) that required more {FNA} passes ({\textless}2 vs {\textgreater}2 passes, 0\% vs 11.8\%, P {\textless} .0001).

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:} Routine application of positron emission tomography/computed tomography ({PET/CT)} for pancreatic cancer staging remains a controversial approach. The purpose of this study was to reassess the clinical impact of {PET/CT} for the detection of distant metastasis of pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} From January 2006 to June 2009, 125 patients with histologically proven pancreatic cancer that had undergone {PET/CT} at our hospital were retrospectively reviewed. To evaluate the clinical efficacy of {PET/CT} on the management plan, the post-{PET/CT} management plans were compared with the pre-{PET/CT} management plans.
{RESULTS:} After the conventional staging workup, we determined that 76 patients (60.8\%) had resectable lesions, whereas 48 patients had unresectable lesions. One patient underwent explorative laparotomy due to equivocal resectability. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography diagnosed distant metastasis in only 2 (2.6\%) of the 76 patients with resectable lesions, and these patients did not undergo unnecessary surgical treatment. Complete resection was not performed in 8 of the 74 operative patients because they had distant metastasis detected during the operative procedure. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography diagnosed distant metastasis in 32 of the 44 patients with metastatic lesions that were histologically shown to have sensitivity of 72.7\%.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} Tumor markers are substances found in blood and other biological fluids if tumor is present in the body. They can be produced by tumor itself or can be results of cancer - body relation. They may be used in the follow-up of cancer patients to identify tumor recurrence. Pre-treatment levels have prognostic tool and could signalize persistence of minimal residual disease despite radical surgery.
{METHODS:} We operated on 52 patients with upper {GI} malignancy (32 with gastric cancer and 20 with pancreatic cancer). Blood samples were taken before surgery and peritoneal samples immediately after laparotomy before any manipulation with tumor. All samples were examined by standard biochemical technique and the level was compared with a stage of the disease.
{RESULTS:} Patients suffering from gastric carcinoma of stage I and {II} had higher level of both markers in sera then in the peritoneal cavity, however most of them were within physiological range. Patients in stage {III} and {IV} had average marker levels in the peritoneal cavity higher than in sera. Number of positive findings was increasing according to the stage of the disease. The peritoneal levels of both markers varied extremely in higher stages. In patients suffering from pancreatic carcinoma the {CEA} levels both in sera and peritoneal cavity were parallel but peritoneal levels were slightly higher in stages {III} and {IV.} Ca 19 - 9 was more sensitive for pancreatic cancer. The percentage of positive findings was higher in sera but the level of Ca 19 - 9 was higher in the peritoneal cavity. The number of positive findings again correlated with the stage of the disease.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Levels of tumor markers in sera could signalize inoperability of tumor (Ca 19 - 9 in cases of pancreatic carcinoma); peritoneal levels could predict R1 resection especially in gastric cancer patients and risk of early peritoneal recurrence of the disease. Difference between the levels in the peritoneum and sera may signalize the route of dissemination (hematogenous and intraperitoneal).},

	abstract = {Surgery for pancreatic pseudocysts ({PPCs)} may be associated with high rates of complication and mortality. Since its introduction in the late 1980s, endoscopic drainage of {PPCs} has become established as an alternative nonsurgical approach. The obvious limitation of this technique is its relatively blind approach. The ideal approach for {PPC} puncture combines endoscopy with real-time endosonography using an interventional echoendoscope. Endoscopic ultrasonographic longitudinal scanners can be used for guidance of transmural punctures and drainage procedures, as well as to access a dilated pancreatic duct if the duct cannot be drained by conventional methods because of complete obstruction. In this chapter, we will review the indications, techniques and clinical algorithm for {EUS-guided} pseudocyst drainage and pancreaticogastrostomy.},

Six of 8 patients who had risk factors of pancreatic cancer such as pancreatic cyst, dilated main pancreatic duct, pancreatitis, or diabetes had been followed-up by imaging and laboratory examinations. Five patients with extrapancreatic disease had been followed-up chiefly by laboratory examinations. The remaining 2 had neither of them. Detectabilities of pancreatic mass in {US}, {CT} and {EUS} were 89\%, 67\% and 100\%, respectively; those of pancreatic mass and/or dilated main pancreatic duct were 100\% in all three modalities.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:} Chronic asymptomatic pancreatic hyperenzymemia ({CAPH)} has been described since 1996 as a benign disease. Recent studies described pathological findings at magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography with secretin stimulation (s-{MRCP)} in more than half of the {CAPH} subjects. The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and clinical relevance of s-{MRCP} findings in patients with {CAPH.}
{METHODS:} Subjects prospectively enrolled from January 2005 to December 2010 underwent s-{MRCP} and biochemical tests routinely performed.
{RESULTS:} Data relative to 160 subjects (94 males, 66 females, age 49.6±13.6 years) were analyzed. In all, 51 (32\%) subjects had hyperamylasemia, 9 (6\%) hyperlipasemia, and 100 (62\%) an increase in both enzyme levels. The time between the first increased dosage of serum pancreatic enzymes and our observation was 3.3±3.9 years (range: 1-15). Familial pancreatic hyperenzymemia was observed in 26 out of 133 subjects (19.5\%). Anatomic abnormalities of the pancreatic duct system at s-{MRCP} were found in 24 out of 160 subjects (15\%). Pathological {MRCP} findings were present in 44 subjects (27.5\%) before and in 80 subjects (50\%) after secretin administration (P{\textless}0.0001). Five subjects (3.1\%) underwent surgery, 3 for pancreatic endocrine tumor, 1 for pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and 1 for intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasia ({IPMN)} involving the main pancreatic duct, and 18 patients (11.3\%) needed a follow-up (17 for {IPMN} and 1 for endocrine tumor).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Alterations of the pancreatic duct system at s-{MRCP} in subjects with {CAPH} can be observed in 50\% of the subjects and are clinically relevant in 14.4\% of cases.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Precise assessment of retroperitoneal invasion is clinically important to allow the achievement of negative margin resections.
{METHODS:} The clinical records of 132 patients who underwent macroscopic curative pancreaticoduodenectomy for invasive ductal carcinoma of the pancreas between 2004 and 2008 were retrospectively examined. The clinicopathological factors, including retroperitoneal fat infiltration classified into four groups by multidetector-row computed tomography ({MDCT)}, were analyzed. The relationship between the grade of retroperitoneal fat infiltration and surgical outcomes, as well as various histopathological factors, was also investigated.
{RESULTS:} The 5 year survival rate was 55.6 \% for grade 0 infiltration (n = 8), 38.7 \% for grade 1 (n = 54), 16.4 \% for grade 2 (n = 49), and 0 \% for grade 3 (n = 21). There were significant differences in survival in each group. Extrapancreatic nerve invasion and the surgical margin status were significantly associated with retroperitoneal fat infiltration demonstrated on {MDCT.} According to the grading classification among the 43 patients with pathological portal vein invasion, the 5 year survival rate was 45.9 \% for patients with grade 1, which was significantly better survival that those with grade 2 (P = 0.007).
{CONCLUSION:} The grading criteria for retroperitoneal fat infiltration may be useful as a predictor of survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic head carcinoma. Pancreaticoduodenectomy with portal vein resection could provide favorable survival in patients with grade 1 retroperitoneal fat infiltration, even if histopathological portal vein invasion is present.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:} To compare respiratory-triggered, free-breathing, and breath-hold {DWI} techniques regarding (1) image quality, and (2) signal intensity ({SI)} and {ADC} measurements in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ({PDAC).}
{METHODS:} Fifteen patients with histopathologically proven {PDAC} underwent {DWI} prospectively at 1.5 T (b = 0, 50, 300, 600 and 1,000 s/mm(2)) with the three techniques. Two radiologists, independently and blindly, assigned total image quality scores [sum of rating diffusion images (lesion detection, anatomy, presence of artefacts) and {ADC} maps (lesion characterisation, overall image quality)] per technique and ranked them. The lesion {SI}, signal-to-noise ratio, mean {ADC} and coefficient of variation ({CV)} were compared.
{RESULTS:} Total image quality scores for respiratory-triggered, free-breathing and breath-hold techniques were 17.9, 16.5 and 17.1 respectively (respiratory-triggered was significantly higher than free-breathing but not breath-hold). The respiratory-triggered technique had a significantly higher ranking. Lesion {SI} on all b-values and signal-to-noise ratio on b300 and b600 were significantly higher for the respiratory-triggered technique. For respiratory-triggered, free-breathing and breath-hold techniques the mean {ADCs} were 1.201, 1.132 and 1.253 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, and mean {CVs} were 8.9, 10.8 and 14.1 \% respectively (respiratory-triggered and free-breathing techniques had a significantly lower mean {CV} than the breath-hold technique).
{CONCLUSION:} In both analyses, respiratory-triggered {DWI} showed superiority and seems the optimal {DWI} technique for demonstrating {PDAC.}
{KEY} {POINTS:} • Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is increasingly used to detect pancreatic cancer • Images are acquired using various breathing techniques and multiple b-values • Breathing techniques used: respiratory-triggering, free-breathing and breath-hold • Respiratory-triggering seems the optimal breathing technique for demonstrating pancreatic cancer.},

We aimed to compare the influence of the biliary plastic and fully covered self-expanding metal stents ({CSEMS)} on the accuracy of {EUS-FNA} cytology in patients with solid pancreatic masses.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} We conducted a retrospective study evaluating 677 patients with solid pancreatic head/uncinate lesions and a previous biliary stent in whom {EUS-FNA} was performed. The patients were stratified into two groups: (1) those with a plastic stents and (2) those with {CSEMS.} Performance characteristics of {EUS-FNA} including the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were compared between the two groups.
{RESULTS:} The frequency of obtaining an adequate cytology by {EUS-FNA} was similar in both the {CSEMS} group and the plastic stent group (97 vs. 97.1 \% respectively; p = 1.0). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of {EUS-FNA} was not significantly different between patients with {CSEMS} and plastic stents (96.8, 100, 100 \% and 97.3, 98, 99.8 \%, respectively). The negative predictive value for {EUS-FNA} was lower in the {CSEMS} group compared to the plastic stent group (66.6 vs. 78.1 \% respectively; p = 0.42). There was one false-positive cytology in the plastic stent group compared to none in the {CSEMS} group.
{CONCLUSIONS:} In a retrospective cohort trial, {EUS-FNA} was found to be highly accurate and safe in diagnosing patients with suspected pancreatic cancer, even in the presence of a plastic or metallic biliary stent.

{RESULTS:} Twenty-seven patients were diagnosed during the study period: 18 with solid pseudopapillary neoplasm ({SPN)}, 6 with pancreatic endocrine neoplasia, and 3 with other tumors. Of the 27 children, 3 had associated syndromes, in specific tuberous sclerosis, von Hippel-Lindau, and polycystic ovarian syndrome. The most common symptoms were pain and vomiting in {SPN} and hypoglycemia and seizures in insulinomas. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic scan were equally accurate in determining size and site of origin of the tumor, and both were better than ultrasound. All patients underwent surgery (distal pancreatectomy in 14 cases, Whipple procedure in 8, other procedures in 5), which represented the only treatment for all but 3 cases. Seventeen patients (94\%) with {SPN} are alive (median follow-up, 32 months), 3 of whom had positive margins.

{OBJECTIVE:} Our purpose was to validate {RF} spectral analysis as a method to distinguish between chronic pancreatitis ({CP)} and pancreatic cancer ({PC).}
{DESIGN} {AND} {SETTING:} A prospective study of eligible patients was conducted to analyze the {RF} data obtained by using electronic array echoendoscopes.
{PATIENTS:} Pancreatic images were obtained by using electronic array echoendoscopes from 41 patients in a prospective study, including 15 patients with {PC}, 15 with {CP}, and 11 with a normal pancreas.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} Midband fit, slope, intercept, correlation coefficient, and root mean square deviation from a linear regression of the calibrated power spectra were determined and compared among the groups.
{RESULTS:} Statistical analysis showed that significant differences were observable between groups for mean midband fit, intercept, and root mean square deviation (t test, P {\textless} .05). Discriminant analysis of these parameters was then performed to classify the data. For {CP} (n = 15) versus {PC} (n = 15), the same parameters provided 83\% accuracy and an area under the curve of 0.83.
{LIMITATIONS:} Moderate sample size and spatial averaging inherent in the technique.
{CONCLUSIONS:} This study shows that mean spectral parameters of the backscattered signals obtained by using electronic array echoendoscopes can provide a noninvasive method to quantitatively discriminate between {CP} and {PC.}},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:} To describe the occurrence of pancreatic, biliary tract, and gallbladder cancers within the Alaska Native ({AN)} population. Study design: Population-based analysis utilizing a tumor registry and comparative population data.
{METHODS:} Pancreaticobiliary cancers rates for {AN} people during 1973-2007 were determined from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ({SEER)} {AN} Tumor Registry. Cancer incidence rates were age-adjusted to the World Standard Million and compared over 2 time periods with {US} white and black rates.
{RESULTS:} During 1973-2007, 213 {AN} people developed pancreatic cancer, 73 gallbladder cancer and 61 biliary tract cancer. Pancreatic cancer occurs at similar rates in {AN} men and women, but data for 1993-2007 indicate that the rates among {AN} men may be increasing. The incidence rate in {AN} women (9.5/100,000) was statistically higher than in {US} white women (5.8/100,000). The incidence for biliary tract cancer in {AN} men and gallbladder cancer in {AN} men and women is statistically higher than that for {US} whites and blacks.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Pancreaticobiliary cancers, particularly biliary tract and gallbladder cancers, in both {AN} men and women and pancreatic cancer in women occur at an increased rate in {AN} people. Risk factors relating to the elevated rate are discussed. Certain factors are potentially modifiable, such as the use of tobacco and obesity.},

Dilation of {CBD} and {PD} is frequently noted on computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging scans, sometimes found incidentally in patients without jaundice. The prevalence of malignancy in these patients is not established.
{METHODS:} In this retrospective analysis, consecutive patients who underwent endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} at a tertiary care hospital from 2002 to 2006 for suspected pancreatic malignancy and had double-duct sign on imaging were included. We evaluated (1) prevalence of malignancy in patients with or without obstructive jaundice and (2) performance characteristics of {EUS-fine-needle} aspiration ({FNA)} in diagnosing malignancy in this setting.
{RESULTS:} A final diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy was made in 142 (85.5\%) of 166 patients with and 4 (5.9\%) of 68 without obstructive jaundice (P {\textless} 0.005). The accuracy of {EUS-FNA} for diagnosing malignancy in patients with or without obstructive jaundice was 92.8\% versus 98.5\%.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Dilation of both {PD} and {CBD} on computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging scans is suggestive of pancreatic malignancy. The prevalence of malignancy, however, is markedly lower in patients without obstructive jaundice but is clinically significant and merits further diagnostic evaluation.

{METHODS:} We performed a meta-analysis of all available studies of the diagnostic performance of {DWI} and {PET/CT} for pancreatic malignancy. {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, Cochrane library and some other databases were searched for initial studies. We determined sensitivities and specificities across studies, calculated positive and negative likelihood ratios ({LR+} and {LR-)}, and constructed summary receiver operating characteristic curves ({SROC)} using hierarchical regression models.
{RESULTS:} Across 16 studies with 804 patients, {PET/CT} sensitivity was 0.87 (95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 0.82, 0.81) and specificity was 0.83 (95\% {CI}, 0.71, 0.91). Overall, {LR+} was 5.84 (95\% {CI}, 4.59, 7.42) and {LR-} was 0.24 (95\% {CI}, 0.17, 0.33). {DWI} sensitivity was 0.85 (95\% {CI}, 0.74, 0.92) and specificity was 0.91 (95\% {CI}, 0.71, 0.98). {LR+} was 9.53 (95\% {CI}, 2.41, 37.65) and {LR-} was 0.17 (95\% {CI}, 0.09, 0.32). In subgroup analysis, the sensitivity of enhanced versus unenhanced {PET/CT} in the detection of pancreatic cancer was 0.91 (95\% {CI}, 0.86, 0.96) versus 0.84 (95\% {CI}, 0.78, 0.90) (P {\textgreater} 0.05), the specificity 0.88 (95\% {CI}, 0.73, 1.00) versus 0.81 (95\% {CI}, 0.69, 0.94) (P {\textgreater} 0.05).
{CONCLUSION:} Positron emission tomography/computed tomography ({PET/CT)} was highly sensitive and {DWI} was a highly specific modality in diagnosing patients with pancreatic malignancy. {PET/CT} and {DWI} could play different roles in diagnosing pancreatic carcinoma. Enhanced {PET/CT} seems to be superior to unenhanced {PET/CT.} Further larger prospective studies are needed to establish its value for diagnosis in pancreatic cancer.},

{METHODS:} Fifty of our first 74 {PET/CT} examinations with {68Ga-DOTA-TOC} could be evaluated in retrospect. None of these patients had surgery or showed any pathology in the pancreas head at the concomitant {CT.}
{RESULTS:} Thirty-five of the 50 examinations (70\%) showed an uptake by the uncinate process sufficiently intense to be interpreted as pathologic and simulating a tumor. Mean {SUVmax} was 9.2. Mean {SUVmean} using an isoactivity cut-off of {\textgreater}75\% and {\textgreater}50\% was 7.8 and 6.0, respectively. Volume calculations of the uncinate process activity using these definitions gave 0.9 {mL} and 4.2 {mL}, respectively.
{CONCLUSION:} There is a frequent physiological uptake of {68Ga-DOTA-TOC} by the pancreas uncinate process. This may be caused by an accumulation of pancreatic polypeptide-containing cells expressing somatostatin receptors. If there is a normal finding at concomitant diagnostic {CT}, this uptake should be regarded as physiological.},

Archived clinical, pathologic, and radiologic data (1965 to present) for hematologic malignancies involving the pancreas were reviewed and compared with the data for 157 surgically resected pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Of 42 cases, 27 (64\%) were clinically "suspicious" for hematologic malignancies. Of the remaining 15 cases, 4 patients underwent resection for presumed pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Isolated pancreatic masses proved most difficult to identify clinically. Significant factors in distinguishing hematologic malignancies from adenocarcinoma included history of hematologic malignancy, young age, large tumor size, low {CA19-9} level, B symptoms, and lack of jaundice or diabetes mellitus. Various hematologic malignancies involve the pancreas, most commonly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Pancreatic masses are usually correctly identified clinically. Preoperative and operative sampling is strongly recommended when hematologic malignancies cannot be excluded.},

{METHODS:} Twenty-two consecutive patients (12 men, 10 women; mean age 64.4 years) with pancreatic cancer underwent {DWI} before surgery. We retrospectively investigated the correlations between tumor {ADC} value and clinicopathologic features.
{RESULTS:} Apparent diffusion coefficient value was significantly lower for pancreatic cancer than for noncancerous tissue (P {\textless} 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis yielded an optimal {ADC} cutoff value of 1.21 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s to distinguish pancreatic cancer from noncancerous tissue. There was a significant negative correlation between {ADC} value and tumor size (r = -0.59, P = 0.004) and between {ADC} value and number of metastatic lymph nodes (r = -0.56, P = 0.007). Tumors with low {ADC} value had a significant tendency to show high portal venous system invasion (P = 0.02) and extrapancreatic nerve plexus invasion (P = 0.01).

Here, we tested the diagnostic accuracy of molecular-based imaging including 3'-deoxy-3'-[({18)F]fluorothymidine} ({FLT)} positron emission tomography ({PET)} and [({18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose} ({FDG)} {PET/CT} in patients with suspected pancreatic masses scheduled to undergo surgery.
{METHODS:} A total of 46 patients with pancreatic tumours suspicious for malignancy and scheduled for resective surgery were recruited prospectively. In 41 patients, {FLT} {PET} and {FDG} {PET/CT} scans were performed. A diagnostic {CT} performed on a routine basis was available in 31 patients. {FLT} {PET} and {FDG} {PET/CT} emission images were acquired according to standard protocols. Tracer uptake in the tumour [{FDG} and {FLT} standardized uptake value ({SUV)]} was quantified by the region of interest ({ROI)} technique. For {FDG} {PET/CT} analysis, correct {ROI} placement was ensured via side-by-side reading of corresponding {CT} images.
{RESULTS:} Of 41 patients, 33 had malignancy, whereas 8 patients had benign disease. Visual analysis of {FDG} and {FLT} {PET} resulted in sensitivity values of 91\% (30/33) and 70\% (23/33), respectively. Corresponding specificities were 50\% (4/8) for {FDG} {PET} and 75\% (6/8) for {FLT} {PET.} In the subgroup of patients with contrast-enhanced {CT} (n = 31), sensitivities were 96\% ({PET/CT)}, 88\% ({CT} alone), 92\% ({FDG} {PET)} and 72\% ({FLT} {PET)}, respectively.

{CONCLUSION:} For differentiation of pancreatic tumours, {FDG} {PET} and {FDG} {PET/CT} showed a higher sensitivity but lower specificity than {FLT} {PET.} Interestingly, visual analysis of {FLT} {PET} led to two false-positive findings by misinterpreting physiological bowel uptake as pathological {FLT} uptake in the pancreas.

Recently, the usefulness of diffusion-weighted imaging ({DWI)} in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer has been reported in several studies.
{PURPOSE:} To investigate if apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC)} measurements based on diffusion-weighted echo-planar imaging ({DW-EPI)} may distinguish between normal pancreas parenchyma, mass-forming focal pancreatitis, and pancreas carcinoma.
{MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS:} {MRI} was performed on 64 patients: 24 with pancreas carcinoma ({PC)}, 20 with mass-forming focal pancreatitis ({FP)}, three patients with other focal pancreatic disease as well as 17 controls without any known pancreatic disease. Diffusion-weighted sequence with {ADC} maps and T2-weighted sequence for anatomical information was performed. Apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC)} maps were automatically created and analyzed using a dedicated user interface. In the group with pancreas disease the abnormal parenchyma was detected by using T1- and T2-weighted images and the region of interest ({ROI)} was transferred exactly to the {ADC} map and the coefficients were registered. In the control group the {ROI} was set to the head of the pancreas followed by a similar registration of the {ADCs.}
{RESULTS:} {ADC} values for mass-forming {FP} and {PC} differed significantly from {ADC} values for normal pancreas parenchyma (P = {0.001/P} = 0.002). Mean {ADC} values for mass-forming {FP} were 0.69 ± 0.18 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s. {ADC} values for {PC} were 0.78 ± 0.11 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s, compared to {ADC} values of 0.17 ± 0.06 × 10(-3) mm(2)/s in the control group. However there was no significant difference in {ADCs} between {PC} and mass-forming {FP} (P = 0.15).
{CONCLUSION:} {ADC} measurements clearly differentiated between normal pancreatic tissue and abnormal pancreas parenchyma ({PC} and mass-forming {FP).} However there is an overlap in values of {PC} and mass-forming {FP}, with the consequent problem of their correct identification.},

{METHODS:} The {MEDLINE}, {EMBASE}, Cancerlit, and Cochrane Library databases, from January 2001 to August 2011, were searched for studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of {DWI} in the discrimination of pancreatic lesions. We determined sensitivities and specificities across studies, calculated positive and negative likelihood ratios ({LR+} and {LR-)}, and constructed summary receiver operating characteristic curves.
{RESULTS:} A total of 11 studies with 586 patients, who fulfilled all of the inclusion criteria, were considered for the analysis. No publication bias was found. The pooled sensitivity of {DWI} was 0.86 [95\% (confidence interval ({CI)}, 0.78, 0.91] and the pooled specificity was 0.91 (95\% {CI}, 0.81, 0.96). Overall, {LR+} was 9.8 (95\% {CI}, 4.1, 23.3) and {LR-} was 0.15 (95\% {CI}, 0.09, 0.26). The area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic was 0.94 (95\% {CI}, 0.91-0.96). In subgroup analysis, prospectively designed studies had the highest pooled sensitivity (0.87, 95\% {CI} 0.75, 0.94) and specificity (0.96, 95\% {CI} 0.91, 0.99) (P{\textless}0.05). Study sensitivity was not correlated with the prevalence of pancreatic lesions (R=0.1076, P=0.3247).
{CONCLUSION:} A limited number of small studies suggest that {DWI} is a potentially technically feasible measure to differentiate malignant from benign pancreatic lesions. However, it is still controversial and is limited in that it can only distinguish certain lesions. High-quality prospective studies on {DWI} for the discrimination of pancreatic lesions still need to be conducted.},

Although the extent of lymph node ({LN)} dissection is the same irrespective of the origin, the lymphatic continuities may differ between the 2 primordia.
{METHODS:} Between March 2003 and September 2010, 152 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic cancer. One hundred six patients were assigned into 2 groups according to tumor location on preoperative computed tomography, and their clinical and pathological features were retrospectively analyzed in view of the embryonic development of the pancreas.
{RESULTS:} Sixty of 106 patients were classified with tumors that were derived from the dorsal pancreas (D group) and 46 from the ventral pancreas (V group). The frequency of {LN} involvement around the middle colic artery ({LN} 15) in the D group was higher than in the V group (P = 0.008). The rate of additional resection of the pancreas tended to be higher in the D group (P = 0.067).

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} The increasing prevalence of adolescent obesity affects adult health. We investigated the association of adolescent overweight with pancreatic cancer incidence in a cohort of 720,927 Jewish Israeli men.
{METHODS:} Body mass index ({BMI)} was measured during a general health examination at ages 16-19 between the years 1967 and 1995. Overweight was defined as {BMI} ≥ 85th percentile of the reference {US-CDC} distribution in adolescence. Pancreatic cancer was identified by linkage with the Israel National Cancer Registry up to 2006.
{RESULTS:} The mean follow-up period was 23.3 ± 8.0 years. During 16.8 million person-years, 98 cases of pancreatic cancer were detected. Using Cox proportional hazards modeling, overweight in adolescence predicted an increased risk of pancreatic cancer [hazard ratio ({HR)} = 2.09; 95\% confidence interval ({CI):} 1.26-3.50, p = 0.005]. Compared with adolescents with 'normal' range {BMI} Z-scores (-1 to +1), adolescents with Z-scores {\textgreater} 1 showed significantly increased risk [{HR}, 2.28 (95\% {CI:} 1.43-3.64), p = 0.001]. Lower education level (10 or less years of schooling vs. 11-12 years) was also associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer [{HR} 1.90 (95\% {CI:} 1.27-2.86, p = 0.002)], whereas height, country of origin and immigration status were not.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Adolescent overweight is substantially associated with pancreatic cancer incidence in young to middle-aged adults. Applying our point estimates to the 16.8\% prevalence of excess weight in Israeli adolescents in the past decade suggests a population fraction of 15.5\% (95\% {CI:} 4.2-29.6\%) for pancreatic cancer attributable to adolescent overweight in Israel.},

Both {MR} and {PET/CT} data sets were retrospectively and blindly evaluated by two independent readers (4 readers total) with different degrees of experience, using a visual five-point score system. The results were correlated with final diagnosis obtained by histopathology.
{RESULTS:} 17 patients had malignant diseases and 10 patients had benign diseases. Depending on the observer, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of {MRI} varied between 88-94\%, 50-80\%, 75-89\% and 71-89\% respectively.

Patients often present with abdominal pain, weight loss, jaundice, itch, and biochemical signs of pancreatitis and cholestasis. Tomography may reveal enlargement of the pancreas or may mimic malignant pancreatic lesions, and cholangiopancreatography may disclose irregularities of the pancreatic duct and stenoses of the distal and/or proximal common bile duct and intrahepatic bile ductules.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} {CT} perfusion has been proposed for pancreatic lesion characterization. However, scan and analysis protocols influence numerical data. To overcome this, the purpose of our study is to evaluate the use of time-density curves obtained from {MDCT} perfusion of the pancreas for the characterization of normal parenchyma, adenocarcinoma, chronic pancreatitis and endocrine tumors.
{METHODS:} 31 patients with solid pancreatic lesions and 21 patients with renal cell carcinoma underwent 64-row {MDCT} perfusion of the pancreas after injection of 50 cc of a 370 mg I/ml solution at 5 cc/s. 63 time-density curves were obtained from normal parenchyma (21 patients), adenocarcinoma (25), endocrine tumors (4) and atrophic parenchyma (13). Two readers independently categorized the 63 time-density curves into 4 different morphologies: normal wash-in and wash-out (A), low wash-in followed by plateau (B), low wash-in followed by faint wash-out (C) and high wash-in and wash-out (D). Interobserver agreement was calculated with kappa statistics. Fisher test was used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, positive ({PPV)} and negative ({NPV)} predictive values for each type of curve.
{RESULTS:} Interobserver agreement was very good (Kappa=0.849). Curve A had 94.4\% sensitivity, 91.1\% specificity, 80.95\% {PPV}, 97.6\% {NPV} for 'normal parenchyma'. Curve B had 74.19\% sensitivity, 93.75\% specificity, 92\% {PPV}, 78.95\% {NPV} in diagnosing 'adenocarcinoma'. Curve C had 45.45\% sensitivity, 84.62\% specificity, 38.46\% {PPV}, 88\% {NPV} for 'chronic pancreatitis'. Curve D had 100\% sensitivity, 98.33\% specificity, 75\% {PPV}, 100\% {NPV} for 'endocrine tumor'.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The morphology of {MDCT} perfusion time-density curves appears to be useful in characterizing pancreatic lesions, and might help overcome the differences in scan and postprocessing techniques.},

{RESULTS:} {MDCT} was performed for suspected pancreatic cancer in 290 patients, and in 258 a pancreatic mass was found. {MDCT} failed to establish a diagnosis in 32 patients (11\%).

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:} A retrospective study was performed to clarify the correlation between radiographic type of portal vein ({PV)} invasion and pathological grade of {PV} wall invasion, and their correlation with postoperative prognosis.
{BACKGROUND:} In many patients with pancreatic cancer, {PV} resection is necessary to increase resectability and obtain cancer-free margins.
{METHODS:} We analyzed 671 patients who had undergone surgery for invasive adenocarcinoma of the pancreas between July 1981 and June 2010. Radiographic types of {PV} invasion of pancreatic head cancer were classified into A (normal), B (unilateral narrowing), C (bilateral narrowing), or D (complete obstruction with collateral veins), by portography or computed tomography. Pathological grades of {PV} wall invasion were classified as 0 (no invasion), 1 (tunica adventitia), 2 (tunica media), or 3 (tunica intima).
{RESULTS:} Four hundred and sixty-three patients underwent resection, and {PV} resection was performed in 297. Combined arterial vessel resection was performed in 16 cases. No significant difference in operative mortality was observed between {PV} preservation (0.6\%) and {PV-only} resection (2.1\%), and no operative deaths occurred after 1999. Radiographic classification of {PV} invasion correlated with incidence of pathological {PV} wall invasion. In pancreatic head carcinoma, no pathological {PV} wall invasion was observed in type A (n = 111). Pathological {PV} invasion was observed in 51\% of type B (42/82), 74\% of type C (72/97), and 93\% of type D (63/68). Long-term survival ({\textgreater}5 years) was observed in types A and B, and grades 0 and 1 subgroups.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Pancreatectomy with {PV} resection can be performed safely. Even in radiographic classification type B, pathological {PV} wall invasion was observed in 51\% of patients. Long-term survival was observed in types A and B, and grades 0 and 1.},

We conducted a prospective trial to compare {EUS} and {MDCT}, in discriminating benign/malignant, in determining local and vascular invasion of a suspected pancreatic cancer and deciding its resectability.
{METHODOLOGY:} The study was performed at the Gastroenterology Department of Izmir Ataturk Training and Research Hospital, from June 2009 to June 2010, all patients with suspected pancreatic and periampullary tumors referred to our department were enrolled. A total of 56 patients were evaluated at the beginning. Five patients having distal {CBD} tumor (n=2), gallbladder tumor (n=1) and papillary tumor (n=2) were excluded from the study. Analysis was done for the remaining 51 patients.
{RESULTS:} For the diagnosis of resectability/unresectability, {EUS} alone demonstrated a definite role in 4 (9\%) of the 43 patients in confirming surgical and pathologic results and {MDCT} alone demonstrated a definite role in 6 (14\%) of the 43 patients in confirming their results. An accurate diagnostic decision regarding resectability/unresectability was accomplished in 27 (63\%) patients with {EUS} and {MDCT.}
{CONCLUSIONS:} While {MDCT} is clinically quite effective, in terms of a correct resectability/unresectability decision, {EUS} should also be used.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION:} The objective of the study was to identify the predictive factors for malignancy in pancreatic head mass as a primary outcome and assess the value of {CA} 19-9 as a diagnostic tool for malignancy as a secondary outcome.
{METHODS:} A prospective study of patients presented with pancreatic head mass was conducted in a tertiary care referral hospital, Manipal, India from May 2006 to November 2008. The study population was divided into malignant and benign groups based on the final histopathology report. A univariate and multivariate analysis of potential predictive factors for malignancy were conducted.
{RESULTS:} A total of 102 patients with pancreatic head mass were included in the study after fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 78 were malignant and 24 were benign. There was significant weight loss (p{\textless}0.001) and high mean bilirubin levels (p=0.002) in the malignant group. Mean {CA} 19-9 was significantly higher in the malignant group (290.7 vs. 30.3 U/ml; p{\textless}0.001). Sensitivity and specificity of {CA} 19-9 for detecting malignancy in pancreatic head mass at a cut off of 35 U/ml was 86\% and 79\% respectively. {CA} 19-9 positivity rate was higher with increasing cut off values of 100, 200 and 300 U/ml but such high levels occurred in fewer patients. All the non-jaundiced patients (100\%) with raised {CA} 19-9 levels were found to be malignant compared to 86\% malignancy in jaundiced patients. In multivariate analysis, a combination of weight loss{\textgreater}10\% of body weight and bilirubin{\textgreater}3 mg/dl and {CA} 19-9{\textgreater}35 U/ml had specificity and positive predictive value of 100\% for predicting malignancy in pancreatic head mass.
{CONCLUSION:} The presence of weight loss and jaundice and raised {CA} 19-9 levels together in a patient with pancreatic head mass can be predictive of malignancy. A very high {CA} 19-9 level can be an indicator of malignancy in a pancreatic head mass. A raised {CA} 19-9 level may be more predictive of malignancy in non-jaundiced patients than in jaundiced patients.},

{METHODS:} Patients undergoing pancreatic {EUS} were identified from a computerised radiology database. The strengths of agreement between the radiological and histopathological stages were determined by the weighted kappa (Kw) statistic.
{RESULTS:} Fifty-eight patients were identified. Of 37 patients with a pancreatic head mass on prior imaging, 32 had a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma confirmed by {EUS}, as did 11 of 21 patients with suspicious pancreatic head lesions. Twenty-five of 43 patients were deemed to have resectable carcinomas, and 2 patients had resectable mucinous lesions. In comparing {CT} and {EUS} in the 25 patients undergoing resection, the Kw for T and N stages was 0.250 (p = 0.05) and -0.080 (p = 0.288), respectively, for {CT}, compared with 0.738 (p = 0.0001) and 0.606 (p = 0.0001), respectively, for {EUS.}
{CONCLUSIONS:} {EUS} was effective in assessing the resectability of pancreatic head adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, {EUS} held a significant 3-fold advantage over {CT} with regard to T stage and an even higher significant advantage with regard to N stage.},

{METHODS:} We evaluated the two cohorts for common duct and pancreatic duct dilatation, mesenteric vascular encasement, root of mesentery invasion, perineural invasion and duodenal invasion. In addition, we compared the clinical findings at presentation in both groups.
{RESULTS:} Common duct (P {\textless} 0.001) and pancreatic duct dilatation (P = 0.001) were significantly less common in uncinate process adenocarcinomas than in the non-uncinate head of the pancreas. Clinical findings of jaundice (P = 0.01) and pruritis (P = 0.004) were significantly more common in patients with lesions in the non-uncinate head of the pancreas. Superior mesenteric artery encasement (P = 0.02) and perineural invasion (P = 0.001) were significantly more common with uncinate process adenocarcinomas.

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} {CT} examinations of 17 patients affected by pancreatic metastases were retrospectively reviewed. The primary malignancy was renal cell carcinoma ({RCC)} in eight cases, uterine leiomyosarcoma in two, lung carcinoma in four and breast carcinoma in three. {CT} images were assessed for lesion number, size and morphology.
{RESULTS:} Pancreatic lesions were solitary in seven cases and multiple in ten. Lesion size ranged between 8 and 40 mm. Metastases from {RCC} were hyperattenuating in the arterial phase, metastases from breast cancer and lung cancer were hypoattenuating and metastases from uterine leiomyosarcoma were inhomogeneous. Precise lesion characterisation was obtained by using {CT} examination in 12 cases. In the remaining five patients, all with solitary metastases from {RCC}, a precise diagnosis was not possible because the lesions could not be differentiated from a neuroendocrine tumour.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {MDCT} allowed pancreatic metastases characterisation in 70.5\% of cases. The lesions were the manifestation of widely disseminated neoplastic disease, with the exception of metastases from {RCC}, which were exclusively located in the pancreas.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:} Contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasonography ({CH-EUS)}, a novel technology, visualizes parenchymal perfusion in the pancreas. This study prospectively evaluated how accurately {CH-EUS} characterizes pancreatic lesions and compared its diagnostic ability with that of contrast-enhanced multidetector-row computed tomography ({MDCT)} and endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA).}
{METHODS:} A total of 277 consecutive patients with pancreatic solid lesions that were detected by conventional {EUS} underwent {CH-EUS} for evaluation of vascularity. After infusing an ultrasound contrast, {CH-EUS} was performed by using an echoendoscope and a specific mode for contrast harmonic imaging. On the basis of the intensity of enhancement, the lesions were categorized into four patterns: nonenhancement, hypoenhancement, isoenhancement, and hyperenhancement. For comparison, all patients underwent {MDCT.} The ability of {CH-EUS} to differentiate ductal carcinomas from the other solid tumors, particularly small lesions (≤2 cm in diameter) was assessed, and compared with the differentiating abilities of {MDCT} and {EUS-FNA.}
{RESULTS:} In terms of reading the {CH-EUS} images, the κ-coefficient of the interobserver agreement test was 0.94 (P{\textless}0.001). {CH-EUS-depicted} hypoenhancement diagnosed ductal carcinomas with a sensitivity and specificity of 95.1\% (95\% confidence interval ({CI)} 92.7-96.7\%) and 89.0\% (95\% {CI} 83.0-93.1\%), respectively. For diagnosing small carcinomas by {CH-EUS}, the sensitivity and specificity were 91.2 \% (95\% {CI} 82.5-95.1\%) and 94.4\% (95\% {CI} 86.2-98.1\%), respectively. {CH-EUS-depicted} hypervascular enhancement diagnosed neuroendocrine tumors with a sensitivity and specificity of 78.9\% (95\% {CI} 61.4-89.7\%) and 98.7\% (95\% {CI} 96.7-98.8\%), respectively. Although {CH-EUS} and {MDCT} did not differ significantly in diagnostic ability with regard to all lesions, {CH-EUS} was superior to {MDCT} in diagnosing small (≤2 cm) carcinomas (P{\textless}0.05). In 12 neoplasms that {MDCT} failed to detect, 7 ductal carcinomas and 2 neuroendocrine tumors had hypoenhancement and hyperenhancement on {CH-EUS}, respectively. When {CH-EUS} was combined with {EUS-FNA}, the sensitivity of {EUS-FNA} increased from 92.2 to 100\%.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {CH-EUS} is useful for characterizing conventional {EUS-detected} solid pancreatic lesions. {EUS} equipped with contrast harmonic imaging may play an important role in the characterization of small tumors that other imaging methods fail to depict and may improve the diagnostic yield of {EUS-FNA.}},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The urokinase plasminogen activator receptor is highly expressed and its gene is amplified in about 50\% of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas; this last feature is associated with worse prognosis. It is unknown whether the level of its soluble form ({suPAR)} in urine may be a diagnostic-prognostic marker in these patients.
{METHODS:} The urinary level of {suPAR} was measured in 146 patients, 94 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and 52 chronic pancreatitis. Urine from 104 healthy subjects with similar age and gender distribution served as controls. {suPAR} levels were normalized with creatinine levels ({suPAR/creatinine}, ng/mg) to remove urine dilution effect.
{RESULTS:} Urinary {suPAR/creatinine} values of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients were significantly higher (median 9.8; 25th-75th percentiles 5.3-20.7) than those of either healthy donors (median 0; 0-0.5) or chronic pancreatitis patients (median 2.7; 0.9-4.7). The distribution of values among cancer patients was widespread and asymmetric, 53\% subjects having values beyond the 95th percentile of healthy donors. The values of {suPAR/creatinine} did not correlate with tumour stage, Ca19-9 or {CEA} levels. Higher values correlated with poor prognosis among non-resected patients at univariate analysis; multivariate Cox regression identified high urinary {suPAR/creatinine} as an independent predictor of poor survival among all cancer patients (odds ratio 2.10, p = 0.0023), together with tumour stage (stage {III} odds ratio 2.65, p = 0.0017; stage {IV} odds ratio 4.61, p {\textless} 0.0001) and female gender (odds ratio 1.85, p = 0.01).

{METHODS:} {TBFs} of pancreatic tumors in 14 consecutive patients were measured by means of xenon-{CT} at diagnosis and following therapy. Serial abdominal {CT} scans were obtained before and after inhalation of nonradioactive xenon gas. {TBF} was calculated using the Fick principle. Furthermore, intratumoral microvessels were stained with anti-{CD34} monoclonal antibodies before being quantified by light microscopy (×200). We evaluated {MVD} based on {CD34} expression and correlated it with {TBF.}
{RESULTS:} The quantitative {TBF} of pancreatic tumors measured by xenon {CT} ranged from 22.3 to 111.4 ml/min/100 g (mean ± {SD}, 59.6 ± 43.9 ml/min/100 g). High correlation (r = 0.885, P {\textless} 0.001) was observed between {TBF} and intratumoral {MVD.}
{CONCLUSION:} Xenon-{CT} is feasible in patients with pancreatic tumors and is able to accurately estimate {MVD} noninvasively.},

	abstract = {Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is one of the top ten leading causes of cancer deaths and in the {UK} around 8,000 people are diagnosed with the disease each year. The incidence is similar in men and women and rises with age. Rates increase significantly in people aged 45 years and over and around three-quarters of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer are over the age of 65. Overall, the long-term prognosis of the disease is poor with a one-year survival rate of approximately 10-20\%. The presenting symptoms are largely dependent on tumour location. Approximately half of patients are diagnosed with a tumour within the head of the pancreas and many of these will present with jaundice. Around half of patients with carcinoma of the head of pancreas will present with abdominal or back pain, which itself is an independent predictor of poor outcome. Rapid unintentional weight loss should raise clinical suspicion and is associated with shorter survival; and recent onset diabetes may serve as a warning sign. Individuals with two or more first-degree relatives with pancreatic cancer are at increased risk, even if no gene defect is identified. There are also a number of familial cancer syndromes which, although rare, carry a significantly higher risk. Patients with chronic pancreatitis from any aetiology have an approximately 15-fold higher risk than the general population, while diabetes mellitus, smoking and obesity have relative risks of around 2. In the {UK}, patients over the age of 40 with presenting symptoms of unexplained weight loss in combination with upper abdominal or back pain or late onset diabetes, in whom pancreatic cancer is suspected, should be referred for an urgent pancreatic protocol contrast-enhanced {CT} scan as a first-line investigation. {GPs} without direct access to {CT} should refer to a gastroenterologist or surgeon, in line with the two-week cancer target wait.},

{METHODS:} Patients with {PC} {TNM} stage {III} or {IV} were included. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed 2 weeks before and after the {HIFU.} The ablating tumor volume was calculated by ratio of the nonperfused necrotic area of the planned area on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image on post-{HIFU} magnetic resonance imaging. The ablation results were stratified into 4 ranges: 100\% to 90\% unenhanced area of targeting area, 90\% to 50\%, within 50\%, and no change.
{RESULTS:} High-intensity focused ultrasound treatment was performed without severe adverse event in 46 patients, 49 times (male-female = 25:21; mean age, 60.7 ± 10.0; {TNM} stage 3-stage 4 = 18:28). Average size of the {PC} lesion was 4.2 ± 1.4 cm (1.6-9.3 cm). After {HIFU} treatment, ablating tumor volume was as follows: 90\% to 100\% in 38 lesions, 90\% to 50\% in 8, and within 50\% in 3. Overall median survival (S1) from initial {PC} diagnosis was 12.4 months. Overall survival (S2) rates at 6, 12, and 18 months from {HIFU} were 52.2\%, 30.4\%, and 21.79\%, respectively, with a median survival of 7.0 months

{OBJECTIVE:} To evaluate the feasibility of {nCLE} during {EUS-FNA} of pancreatic lesions.
{DESIGN:} Feasibility study.
{SETTING:} Multicenter, tertiary care.
{PATIENTS:} Eighteen patients presenting for {EUS-FNA.}
{INTERVENTIONS:} Patients were injected with 2.5 {mL} of 10\% fluorescein. The lesion was interrogated with the {nCLE} probe positioned at the tip of a 19-gauge {FNA} needle.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} Device integrity, technical ease, safety, and image acquisition.
{RESULTS:} Cases included 16 cysts and 2 masses. There were no device malfunctions. Technical challenges were encountered in 6 of 18 attempts to image and reflected challenges with a postloading technique, the longer ferule tip, and a transduodenal approach. Technical feasibility to perform imaging with {nCLE} during a pancreatic {EUS-FNA} procedure was achieved in 17 of 18 cases. Ten cases had good to very good image quality. Two serious adverse events occurred; both were pancreatitis requiring hospitalization.
{LIMITATIONS:} Limited sample size, small number of patients with confirmed pathological diagnosis, lack of coregistered pathology and images.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {nCLE} in the pancreas is technically feasible via a 19-gauge needle under endosonographic guidance. Future studies will address identification of structures, diagnostic accuracy, and complication profiles. The rate of pancreatitis needs to be further clarified and mitigated.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION:} Routine palliative bypass has been advocated for palliation of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma who have inoperable disease discovered at the time of surgery. We examined trends in the relative use of palliative bypass over time with an emphasis on identifying changes in surgical indications, type of bypass performed, as well as perioperative outcomes associated with surgical palliation.
{METHODS:} Between 1996 and 2010, 1,913 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the head of the pancreas were surgically explored. Data regarding preoperative symptoms, intraoperative findings, type of surgical procedure performed, as well as perioperative and long-term outcomes were collected and analyzed.
{RESULTS:} Of the 1,913 patients, 583 (30.5\%) underwent a palliative procedure. Most patients presented with jaundice (72.2\%). The majority of patients were evaluated by {CT} scan (97.4\%), which revealed a median tumor size of 3.2 cm. Most patients who underwent surgical palliation (64.5\%) had a double bypass, while a minority had either gastrojejunostomy (28.2\%) or hepaticojejunostomy (7.2\%) alone. While the number of pancreaticoduodenectomies remained relatively stable over time, there was a temporal decrease in the utilization of palliative bypass (P {\textless} 0.001). Unanticipated locally advanced disease vs. liver/peritoneal metastasis as the indication for palliative surgery also changed over time (1996-2001: 47.8\% vs. 52.2\%; 2002-2007: 49.2\% vs. 50.8\%; 2008-2010: 17.2\% vs. 82.7\%) (P = 0.005). Palliative failure rates were 2.3\% after hepaticojejunostomy and 3.1\% after grastrojejunostomy. Patients with unsuspected metastatic disease had a worse survival compared with patients who had locally unresectable disease (median survival: 5 vs. 8 months, respectively; {HR} = 1.43, P = 0.001).
{CONCLUSION:} Palliative bypass procedures were less frequently performed over time, probably due to a significant decrease in the rate of unanticipated advanced locoregional disease at the time of exploration. While palliative bypass was effective, survival in the setting of metastatic disease was extremely short.},

{METHODS:} We retrospectively evaluated {MDCT} images in 17 patients with pancreatic body and tail carcinoma who underwent surgical resection. Peripancreatic strands appearance was defined as the strands structure deriving from the primary lesion and associated with increased {CT} attenuation of surrounding adipose tissues. All {CT} examinations were performed by contrast-enhanced {MDCT} with a multiplanar reformation technique.
{RESULTS:} Peripancreatic strands appearance was detected on {MDCT} in 13 (76\%) patients. The maximum width of the peripancreatic strands seen on {MDCT} was 1.55 ± 0.36 mm (range, 1.0-2.5 mm). This {CT} finding was well correlated with extrapancreatic carcinoma invasion with marked fibrotic thickening of adipose tissue septa, including microvessels. This pathological finding was confirmed in all 13 patients with positive {CT} finding whereas it was not confirmed in the 4 patients with negative {CT} finding.
{CONCLUSION:} Peripancreatic strands appearance on {MDCT} in pancreatic body and tail carcinoma reflects extrapancreatic carcinoma invasion with marked fibrotic thickening of adipose tissue septa. This {CT} finding would indicate the property of carcinoma aggressiveness.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Several environmental risk factors are known to predispose individuals to pancreatic cancer, and up to 15\% of pancreatic cancers have an inherited component. Understanding metachronous cancer associations can modify pancreas cancer risk. The objective of this study was to investigate the association of nonpancreatic cancers with subsequent pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
{METHODS:} The authors used data from the {US} Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results ({SEER)} registries to identify 1,618,834 individuals who had a primary malignancy and subsequent pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 4013). Standardized incidence ratios were calculated as an approximation of relative risk ({RR)} for the occurrence of pancreatic adenocarcinoma after another primary malignancy.
{RESULTS:} Among patients who were diagnosed with a first primary malignancy at ages 20 to 49 years, the risk of subsequent pancreatic adenocarcinoma was increased among patients who had cancers of the ascending colon (relative risk [{RR]}, 4.62; 95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 1.86-9.52), hepatic flexure ({RR}, 5.42; 95\% {CI}, 1.12-15.84), biliary system ({RR}, 13.14; 95\% {CI}, 4.27-30.66), breast ({RR}, 1.32; 95\% {CI}, 1.09-1.59), uterine cervix ({RR}, 1.61; 95\% {CI}, 1.02-2.41), testes ({RR}, 2.78; 95\% {CI}, 1.83-4.05), and hematopoietic system ({RR}, 1.83; 95\% {CI}, 1.28-2.53). Among patients who had a first malignancy at ages 50 to 64 years, the risk was increased after cancers of the stomach ({RR}, 1.88; 95\% {CI}, 1.13-2.93), hepatic flexure ({RR}, 2.25; 95\% {CI}, 1.08-4.13), lung and bronchus ({RR}, 1.46; 95\% {CI}, 1.16-1.82), pharynx ({RR}, 2.26; 95\% {CI}, 1.13-4.04), and bladder ({RR}, 1.24; 95\% {CI}, 1.03-1.48). Among patients who had a primary cancer after age 65 years, the risk was increased after cancers of the stomach ({RR}, 1.79; 95\% {CI}, 1.23-2.53), hepatic flexure ({RR}, 1.76; 95\% {CI}, 1.06-2.75), biliary system ({RR}, 2.35; 95\% {CI}, 1.17-4.20), and uterus ({RR}, 1.23; 95\% {CI}, 1.03-1.47).

Imaging and pathological findings were retrospectively evaluated for 25 patients with branch duct {IPMNs} of the pancreas who underwent surgical resection (13 adenomas, 4 borderline lesions, and 8 carcinomas). {MDCT} and {MRCP} were performed on all 25 patients, whereas {EUS} was performed on 22 patients. {MDCT} and {MRCP} were used to identify features predictive of malignancy, including carcinoma, borderline lesions, and the presence of thickened irregular walls/septa or a solid mass. {EUS} was used to identify the presence of intramural nodules or a solid mass. Correlations between histopathology and maximum diameter of the main pancreatic duct ({MPD)} or cyst size detected by {MDCT} and {MRCP} were also examined. Presence of a solid mass was highly correlated with malignancy with all imaging methods ({MDCT;} P=0.001, {MRCP;} P=0.008, {EUS;} P{\textless}0.001, respectively). Presence of thickened irregular walls/septa on {MDCT} correlated well with malignancy (P=0.019). In contrast, presence of thickened irregular walls/septa on {MRCP} and intramural nodules on {EUS} did not correlate with malignancy. No significant correlation was found between malignancy and average maximum {MPD} diameter or cyst size (P{\textgreater}0.05), though values tended to be larger in malignant tumors. Our results suggest that the presence of thickened irregular walls/septa or a solid mass on {MDCT} are highly correlated with malignancy, and that {MDCT} is useful for diagnosis of branch duct {IPMNs} of the pancreas.},

{OBJECTIVE:} To determine the sensitivity and specificity of {FISH} analysis in patients with inconclusive on-site cytopathology results.
{DESIGN:} Consecutive patients with suspected pancreatic malignancy, nonrandomized cohort study. Final diagnosis was based on either surgical biopsy or disease progression on extended follow-up or death.
{SETTING:} Academic center, tertiary-care referral cancer center.
{PATIENTS:} A total of 212 {EUS} examinations were performed in 206 patients for solid pancreatic lesions over a 24-month period (January 2009-December 2010). {FISH} analysis was done for 69 patients with inconclusive or nonavailable on-site cytology results.
{INTERVENTION:} {EUS-guided} {FNA} ({EUS-FNA)} of solid pancreatic masses with cytology and {FISH} analysis for polysomy of chromosomes 3, 7, and 17 and deletion of 9p21.

{RESULTS:} Patients with positive on-site cytology (110), neuroendocrine tumors (22), insufficient follow-up (1), {FISH} not obtained (3), and renal cancer with pancreatic metastasis (1) were excluded. Sixty-nine patients comprised the study cohort, 54 with malignancy and 15 with benign disease. Sensitivity for malignancy of cytology, {FISH} analysis, and the combination were 61\%, 74\%, and 85\%, respectively (P = .009). {FISH} detected an additional 13 cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma missed by cytology.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} The critical management decision in pediatric pancreatic injuries involves whether or not to operate on patients with grade {II} or {III} injuries. Because of the rarity of these injuries, no one hospital cares for enough patients to determine the outcome of this decision. Given this, the American Pediatric Surgical Association accrued a series of patients with pancreatic injuries from the members of its Trauma Committee.
{METHODS:} A retrospective review of concurrent pancreatic injuries from 9 level 1 pediatric trauma centers was performed.
{RESULTS:} Data on 131 children were submitted. Forty-three patients suffered grade {II} or grade {III} injuries. Twenty patients underwent an operation, and 23 were observed. Patients who underwent an operation had an average length of stay of 16.1 days compared with 14.2 days. Two in the operative group received total parenteral nutrition compared with 12 in the nonoperative group. Eight in the nonoperative group developed a pseudocyst compared with 3 in the operative group.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Children with grade {II} or grade {III} pancreatic injuries managed nonoperatively had a higher rate of pseudocyst, lower rate of reoperation, and a comparable length of stay compared with those who underwent surgery. These data will be used to help design a prospective study of pancreatic injury management.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines {PubMed} knowledge and Electronic Health Records to develop a weighted Bayesian Network Inference ({BNI)} model for pancreatic cancer prediction. We selected 20 common risk factors associated with pancreatic cancer and used {PubMed} knowledge to weigh the risk factors. A keyword-based algorithm was developed to extract and classify {PubMed} abstracts into three categories that represented positive, negative, or neutral associations between each risk factor and pancreatic cancer. Then we designed a weighted {BNI} model by adding the normalized weights into a conventional {BNI} model. We used this model to extract the {EHR} values for patients with or without pancreatic cancer, which then enabled us to calculate the prior probabilities for the 20 risk factors in the {BNI.} The software {iDiagnosis} was designed to use this weighted {BNI} model for predicting pancreatic cancer. In an evaluation using a case-control dataset, the weighted {BNI} model significantly outperformed the conventional {BNI} and two other classifiers (k-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machine). We conclude that the weighted {BNI} using {PubMed} knowledge and {EHR} data shows remarkable accuracy improvement over existing representative methods for pancreatic cancer prediction.},

{METHODS:} Patients who underwent contrast-enhanced {EUS} between January 2007 and June 2009 were analyzed retrospectively, including 48 with pancreatic ductal cancer ({PC)}, 14 with autoimmune pancreatitis ({AIP)}, 13 with mass-forming pancreatitis ({MFP)}, and 16 with pancreatic endocrine tumor ({PET).} After intravenous injection of contrast agent, contrast imaging pattern, {TIC-based} quantitative evaluation, and diagnostic ability of {EUS} in combination with {TIC} to diagnose benignancy or malignancy were assessed.
{RESULTS:} Hypovascular and heterogeneous pattern (42/48) in {PC}, isovascular and homogenous (21/27) in {AIP} and {MFP}, and hypervascular and rapid stained (16/16) in {PET} were observed. The echo intensity reduction rate from the peak at 1 minute was the greatest in {PC} followed by {MFP}, {AIP}, and {PET} (P {\textless} 0.05). The diagnostic accuracies based on contrast imaging pattern (84.0\%) and {TIC} (88.0\%) were higher than those based on B-mode imaging (82.6\%) and dynamic computed tomography (81.3\%). In {EUS} in combination with {TIC}, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rose up to 95.8\%, 92.6\%, and 94.7\%, respectively.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} {EUS} elastography has been used to facilitate the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, but as yet the interpretation of this procedure has been largely subjective. The present study has been designed to validate a quantitative approach for the analysis of {EUS} elastography, and to assess its relationship with pancreatic fibrosis.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} 86 patients with malignant pancreatic masses and 28 control subjects without any evidence of pancreatic diseases were examined by {EUS} elastography. {EUS} video sequences were subjected to a quantitative analysis based on mean hue histogram analysis. Pancreatic fibrosis was determined by quantitative morphometry in tissue specimens from 36 patients.
{RESULTS:} The mean {RGB} (red, green, blue) value was significantly higher in the cancer patients compared to the controls (14.0 ± 0.4 vs. 11.5 ± 0.9; p = 0.0085), albeit with significant overlap between the groups. In contrast, a much sharper separation between the groups was obtained based on the individual color values for blue, green and red (p {\textless} 0.0001, respectively). By these means, 100 \% sensitivity and specificity for the distinction between tumor and normal tissue was obtained for the blue color value, while the red and green color values were less discriminative. The fractional fiber content of the tumors was unrelated to the respective hue histogram color values.
{CONCLUSION:} Quantitative {EUS} elastography allows for clear differentiation between malignant pancreatic tumors and normal tissue. Using this approach, we demonstrated that the stiffness of pancreatic tumors is largely independent of their fiber content.},

The aims of the study were to assess if a dedicated training program in pancreaticobiliary ({PB)} {EUS-FNA} of solid lesions: (1) produced better results at the outset of independent practice than produced at the initiation of service without formal training and (2) produced results comparable with those of an experienced endosonographer.

{METHODS:} A retrospective review from January 2005 to August 2008 of all patients who underwent a {PET/CT} to evaluate a lesion suggestive of pancreatic cancer based on prior imaging. One hundred eighty-four patients underwent {PET/CT}, of which 60 patients had a negative {PET} scan. Of these 60 patients, 56 patients (30 women, 26 men) had endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration or surgical pathology for clinical correlation. The Fisher exact test was used for statistical analysis.
{RESULTS:} The negative predictive value of {PET/CT} was 75\%. Eighteen patients had a benign lesion, 24 patients had a premalignant lesion, and 14 patients had a malignant lesion. In the cystic group, 72.4\% of the {PET/CT-negative} lesions were premalignant compared with the solid group that was only 5.9\%.

{METHODS:} All patients who underwent {EUS-guided} {PFC} drainage over 7 years were enrolled. Indications, demographics, technical details, complications, surgical interventions, and final outcomes were prospectively recorded.
{RESULTS:} Of 148 patients who underwent {EUS}, {PFC} was located in the pancreatic body in 84 (56.8\%), in the tail in 45 (30.4\%), in the head in 15 (10.1\%), and in the uncinate region in four patients (2.7\%). Perforation was encountered at the site of transmural stenting in two patients (1.3\%, 95\% confidence interval [{CI]:} 0.41-4.76) with a pseudocyst in the uncinate region that was drained transgastrically. When compared to other locations, perforation was more common with {PFC} involving the uncinate region (0\% vs 50\%, P = 0.0005). Other complications included bleeding in one (0.67\%, 95\% {CI:} 0.16, 3.68), stent migration in 1 (0.67\%, 95\% {CI:} 0.16, 3.68), and infection in four patients (2.7\%, 95\% {CI:} 1.09, 6.73). Bleeding occurred in a patient with underlying acquired factor {VIII} inhibitors, stent migration in a patient who underwent drainage via the gastric cardia, and infection in two patients with pseudocysts and two with necrosis. While two patients who developed post-procedural infection and one with stent migration were managed endoscopically, both perforations required surgery. Surgical debridement was performed in two patients who developed infection with successful outcomes in one, and death from underlying comorbidity in the other.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Complications are rare during {EUS-guided} drainage of {PFC} and can be managed successfully in most patients.},

Twenty-three patients (66 scans) showed diffuse uptake; 8 patients (16 scans) showed focal uptake. None of these 31 patients had negative findings on their subsequent scans, and vice versa.

The aim of this study was to describe the endosonographic features of gastric ectopic pancreas.
{METHODS:} We retrospectively analyzed a database of all patients who underwent endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS)} at Pusan National University Hospital from July 2006 to August 2010. A total of 26 patients with histologically confirmed ectopic pancreas were included in the study. The {EUS} features of their lesions were analyzed.
{RESULTS:} Ten lesions were located in the antrum, and 16 lesions were located in the body. Nine lesions (34.6\%) showed an umbilication or central dimpling on the surface, and a mural growth pattern was most commonly observed (61.5\%). Twenty-four lesions (92.3\%) showed hypoechoic echogenicity, and 13 lesions (50.0\%) were heterogeneous. The borders were indistinct in 16 lesions (61.5\%) and lobulated margins were observed in 16 lesions (61.5\%). Anechoic cystic or tubular structures appeared in 17 lesions (65.4\%), and 20 lesions (76.9\%) involved two or more sonographic layers.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The characteristic {EUS} features of ectopic pancreas are indistinct borders, lobulated margins, presence of anechoic duct-like structures, a mural growth pattern, and localization within two or more layers.

	abstract = {Since its introduction, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography ({CEUS)} has significantly extended the value of ultrasonography ({US).} {CEUS} can be used to more accurately determine pancreatic lesions compared to conventional {US} or to characterize lesions already detectable by {US.} Thus, {CEUS} can aid in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumors. Using {US} contrast media, it is possible to visually detect microvessels in the majority of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. Thus, the use of quantitatively evaluated transabdominal {CEUS} can help in the differentiation of patients with mass-forming pancreatitis from patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas. In neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors, different enhancement patterns can be observed in relation to the tumor mass: larger ones show a rapid early enhancement sometimes combined with necrotic central structures, and smaller ones disclose a capillary-blush enhancement. Pseudocysts, the most widespread cystic lesions of the pancreas, are not vascularized. They do not show any signal in {CEUS} and remain entirely anechoic in all phases, while true cystic pancreatic tumors usually have vascularized septa and parietal nodules. In summary, {CEUS} is effective for differentiating solid pancreatic tumors in most cases. {CEUS} is safe and cost effective and can better discriminate solid from cystic pancreatic lesions, thereby directing further imaging modalities.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of blood glucose level correction on pancreatic cancer prognosis predictions after curative resection using F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ({FDG} {PET).}
{METHODS:} We enrolled 43 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent preoperative {FDG} {PET.} Patient outcomes were categorized according to cancer recurrence in the clinical period. Maximum standardized uptake values ({SUVmax)} of tumors were measured using {FDG} {PET}, and blood glucose-corrected {SUV} ({SUVgluc)} was calculated as {SUVmax} × blood glucose level/100.
{RESULTS:} Pancreatic cancer recurrence was observed within 9 months in 24 of 43 patients. {SUVgluc}, but not {SUVmax}, was significantly higher in the recurrence group than in the nonrecurrence group. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that {SUVgluc} of 4.8 and {SUVmax} of 3.0 were the best cutoff values for predicting tumor recurrence. The 9-month recurrence-free survival rates were 72.3\% for patients with {SUVgluc} ≤ 4.8, 23.5\% for patients with {SUVgluc} {\textgreater}4.8, 75.0\% for patients with {SUVmax} ≤ 3.0, and 45.0\% for patients with {SUVmax} {\textgreater}3.0. {SUVgluc} was determined to be a significant predictive factor for tumor recurrence, along with differentiation, whereas {SUVmax} was not.

	abstract = {{AIM:} To describe the typical {CEUS} pattern of pancreatic lesions and to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Contrast-enhanced ultrasound ({CEUS)} in their characterization.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} All {US} and {CEUS} examinations of focal pancreatic masses performed in six centers during a period of five years were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were: focal pancreatic mass pathologically proved, visible at ultrasound ({US)} and studied with {CEUS.} All lesions were then evaluated for size, aspect and enhancement pattern. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values with 95\% {CIs} were calculated to define diagnostic accuracy of {CEUS} in respect to pathology. Diagnostic confidence of {US} and {CEUS}, discerning between benign and malignant lesions, were represented by using {ROC} (receiver operating characteristics) curves. Agreement was evaluated by means of k statistics.
{RESULTS:} 1439 pancreatic lesions were included. At {CEUS} the lesions were divided into solid (89\%) and cystic (12\%) masses and classified into six and eight categories, respectively. Among the solid lesions, adenocarcinomas were characterized with an accuracy of 87.8\%. Among the cystic lesions, cystic tumors were diagnosed with an accuracy of 97.1\%. {ROC} curve area increased from 0.637 for {US} to 0.877 for {CEUS} (p{\textless}0.0001). Inter-observer agreement was slightly higher for solid (k=0.78) than cystic (k=0.62) lesions. In none of the centers side effects were reported.
{CONCLUSION:} {CEUS} is accurate in the characterization of pancreatic lesions. {CEUS} should be considered as a complementary imaging method for pancreatic lesions characterization.},

	issn = {1842-1121},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS)} is preferred for guiding drainage of pancreatic fluid collections, with a success rate exceeding 90\% when fluoroscopy is used. When fluoroscopy cannot be used, drainage can still be performed, but no data regarding the safety of such a procedure have yet been published.
{AIM:} To establish the safety of {EUS-guided} drainage without fluoroscopic control and to identify criteria for the selection of suitable patients.
{METHODS:} The pancreatic fluid collections considered suitable for {EUS-guided} drainage were {\textgreater}5 cm in diameter, symptomatic, without ductal communication. We attempted {EUS-guided} drainage of {PC} prospectively in 24 patients: 9 with abscesses and 15 with pseudocysts.
{RESULTS:} Drainage was successful in 20 cases (83.3\%), with complete resolution after a median 18 months' follow-up. {EUS-guided} drainage failed in four patients (16.7\%): one in the abscess group due to symptomatic pneumoperitoneum and three in the pseudocyst group due to thick wall. Drainage failure was associated with a diameter {\textless}6 cm and wall thickness {\textgreater}2 mm and was considered to be due to the sliding of the cystotome on the pseudocyst wall. During follow-up there was one procedure unrelated death (4.1\%) and no pancreatic fluid collections relapses.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Fluoroscopic control represents a helpful tool, but it is not always necessary for {EUS-guided} drainage of pancreatic fluid collections. {EUS-guided} drainage is possible, efficient and safe without fluoroscopy in selected pancreatic fluid collections with a diameter larger than 6 cm and a thin wall. Collections with a thick wall should be drained under fluoroscopy or referred directly for surgery.},

The aim of the study was to investigate the feasibility of the procedure and long-term clinical outcome in patients treated with {EUS-PD.}
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} We retrospectively analyzed our single-center experience over a 10-year period.
{RESULTS:} {EUS-PD} was attempted in 20 patients (24 interventions), with a median age of 64 years (range 36 - 78). Indications for the procedure were post-Whipple symptomatic anastomotic stricture (n = 10) and chronic pancreatitis (n = 10). {EUS-PD} was performed by a transgastric (n = 16) or transbulbar (n = 3) route or with a rendezvous technique (n = 5). Wirsungography was performed in all interventions and successful drainage was achieved in 18 / 20 (90 \%) patients. There were two minor procedure-related complications: bleeding that was treated endoscopically, and a perigastric collection that resolved spontaneously. Median follow up was 37 months (range 3 - 120 months), stent dysfunction occurred in 9 / 18 (50 \%) patients. Out of 18 patients with successful {EUS-PD}, long-term pain resolution was observed in 13 (72 \%). At the last follow-up visit, there were significant decreases in pain scores, from 7.5 to 1.6, and in {MPD} size from 8.1 mm to 3.9 mm. Failure was associated with cancer presence or recurrence.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Technical success rate of {EUS-PD} and clinical long-term pain resolution were 90 \% and 72 \%, respectively. {EUS-PD} is a reliable procedure with a low complication rate. It might therefore replace surgery at expert centers.},

The aim of this study was to assess the efficiency of {EUS} elastography for the differentiation of focal masses in chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} The study group comprised 258 patients with focal pancreatic masses included prospectively at 13 participating centers. Qualitative analysis of the diagnoses made by two expert doctors using all recorded video clips was performed in order to test the interobserver variability. A post-processing software analysis was used to examine the {EUS} elastography videos by calculating average-hue histograms of individual elastography images. The quantitative information was used to calculate intra-observer variability and the accuracy of the method.
{RESULTS:} Qualitative analysis of the recorded videos revealed a kappa value of 0.72. Intra-observer variability analysis revealed that the single measure intraclass correlation ranged between 0.86 and 0.94. The average-hue histogram analysis of the data indicated a sensitivity of 93.4 \%, a specificity of 66.0 \%, a positive predictive value of 92.5 \%, a negative predictive value of 68.9 \%, and an overall accuracy of 85.4 \%, based on a cut-off value of 175.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} An international panel of experts characterized the evidence linking alcoholic beverage consumption to pancreatic cancer as limited. Primary concerns include inconsistent results from underpowered studies, residual confounding by smoking, and the question of whether the association varies by type of alcoholic beverage.
{METHODS:} The association of alcohol intake with pancreatic cancer mortality was examined using data from the Cancer Prevention Study {II}, a prospective study of {US} adults 30 years and older. Alcohol consumption was self-reported on a 4-page questionnaire in 1982. Based on follow-up through December 31, 2006, there were 6847 pancreatic cancer deaths among 1,030,467 participants. Multivariable-adjusted relative risks ({RRs)} and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs)} were computed using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, body mass index, family history of pancreatic cancer, and personal history of gallstones, diabetes mellitus, or smoking.
{RESULTS:} The {RRs} (95\% {CIs)} of pancreatic cancer mortality associated with current intake of less than 1, 1, 2, 3, and 4 or more drinks per day compared with nondrinkers were 1.06 (0.99-1.13), 0.99 (0.90-1.08), 1.06 (0.97-1.17), 1.25 (1.11-1.42), and 1.17 (1.06-1.29), respectively (P{\textless} .001 for trend). Consumption of 3 or more drinks per day was associated with pancreatic cancer mortality in never smokers ({RR}, 1.36; 95\% {CI}, 1.13-1.62) and in ever smokers ({RR}, 1.16; 95\% {CI}, 1.06-1.27). This association was observed for consumption of liquor ({RR}, 1.32; 95\% {CI}, 1.10-1.57) but not beer ({RR}, 1.08; 95\% {CI}, 0.90-1.30) or wine ({RR}, 1.09; 95\% {CI}, 0.79-1.49).

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Over an 8-year period, from 2001 to 2009, we identified 24 patients with solid pancreatic masses incidentally detected by {CT.} There were 13 females and 11 males, with a mean age of 67 years. We determined the indication for initial {CT}, analyzed the {CT} features, and ascertained the clinical follow-up in all the patients.
{RESULTS:} All of the solid masses were malignant. There were 14 adenocarcinomas and 10 neuroendocrine tumors. The most common indications for the initial {CT} were surveillance of an extrapancreatic malignancy (n = 10) and evaluation for hematuria (n = 6). On the initial {CT}, 16 of the patients (67\%) had a clearly visible pancreatic mass. In eight patients isoattenuating masses were identified, only recognized by subtle signs including unexplained dilatation of the pancreatic duct (n = 5) or minimal contour deformity or density of the pancreas (n = 3). The mean survival time for the patients with adenocarcinoma was 21.6 months, and 42 months for the patients with neuroendocrine tumors.
{CONCLUSION:} Although uncommon, incidentally discovered solid pancreatic masses are malignant neoplasms, either ductal adenocarcinomas or neuroendocrine tumors. Unlike incidentally discovered small cystic lesions, solid pancreatic lesions are often biologically aggressive.},

The goal of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of {PALB2} mutations in women with breast cancer without {BRCA1/2} mutations who also had a personal or family history of pancreatic cancer. {PALB2} mutation analysis was performed in 94 non-{BRCA1/2} breast cancer patients with a personal or family history of pancreatic cancer. Two truncating {PALB2} mutations, {c.3549C{\textgreater}CA} and {c.2962C{\textgreater}CT}, were identified resulting in a mutation prevalence of 2.1\%. The proband found to carry the {c.3549C{\textgreater}CA} {PALB2} mutation had a mother diagnosed with both breast and pancreatic cancer; this relative was subsequently confirmed to carry the identical mutation. The proband with the {c.2962C{\textgreater}CT} mutation had a father and paternal aunt diagnosed with pancreatic cancer; neither relative was available for testing. Two novel {PALB2} missense variants were also found, one of which was deemed potentially deleterious. The prevalence rate of {PALB2} mutations in a non-{BRCA1/2} breast cancer population specifically selected for a family history of pancreatic cancer does not appear to be significantly increased compared to that observed in other breast cancer populations studied thus far.

Extensive research on pancreas development over the last few years, largely driven by a translational potential for pancreatic diseases (diabetes, pancreatic cancer, and so on), is markedly advancing our knowledge of these processes. It is a tenable goal that we will one day have a clear, complete picture of the transcriptional and signaling codes that control the entire organogenetic process, allowing us to apply this knowledge in a therapeutic context, by generating replacement cells in vitro, or perhaps one day to the whole organ in vivo. This review summarizes findings in the past 5 years that we feel are amongst the most significant in contributing to the deeper understanding of pancreas development. Rather than try to cover all aspects comprehensively, we have chosen to highlight interesting new concepts, and to discuss provocatively some of the more controversial findings or proposals.

The median time for combined procedures was 75 minutes versus 50 minutes for separate {EUS} and 50 minutes for {ERCP.}
{CONCLUSIONS:} Combined {EUS} and {ERCP} can be performed under the same sedation with a median 25 minute greater procedure length and similarly high yields for diagnostic {EUS-FNA.} A nonsignificant trend toward lower biliary stent placement success rates with combined {ERCP} procedures merits further study. Benefits of a combined procedure may include expedited patient evaluation and the avoidance of repeated sedation.},

Extensive recent research efforts have provided us with greater insight into the etiology of pancreatic cancer and have also improved our means of prognostication. Molecular analysis demonstrated that specific pathways involved in pancreatic carcinogenesis are perhaps more valuable to study than single genetic aberrations. Previous risk factors, including family history, body mass index, and current cigarette smoking, were validated and novel risks, such as {ABO} blood group alleles, were identified. Similar to other illnesses, combinations of healthful habits, such as not smoking, adhering to a Mediterranean dietary pattern, and engaging in physical activity, may decrease pancreatic cancer risk. Finally, {CA} 19-9 levels, the presence of diabetes mellitus, and a six-gene signature provided critical information regarding survival that could help guide treatment of individuals diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} to investigate the impact of pancreatic cancer localization in relation to the response to different interventional pain management methods and determine the method most suitable for satisfactory pain control.
{METHODS:} interventional pain management was carried out by sympathetic block or spinal analgesia. Patients were allocated into 2 groups according to the tumor localization, namely group 1 (n=61; patients with pancreatic cancer confined to the head of pancreas), and group 2 (n=55; patients with pancreatic cancer confined to the body or tail of pancreas).
{RESULTS:} among the patients who had interventional pain management, sufficient analgesia was achieved by sympathetic block in 9 of the 14 (64.3\%) of them in group 1 and only in 3 of the 11 (27.3\%) patients in group 2. Spinal analgesia was used in 5 of the 14 (35.7\%) patients who required interventional pain management in group 1 and in 8 of the 11 (72.7\%) patients in group 2 (p{\textgreater}0.05).
{CONCLUSION:} pain palliation could be achieved by sympathetic block in patients with cancer localized in the head of pancreas while patients with tumor localized in the body and tail experienced sufficient pain palliation by spinal analgesia rather than sympathetic block.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {AIM:} Positron Emission Tomography ({PET)} using ({18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose} ({FDG)} associated with computed tomography ({CT)} is increasingly used for the detection and the staging of pancreatic cancer, but data regarding its clinical added value in pre-surgical planning is still lacking. The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of {FDG} {PET} associated with contrast-enhanced {CT} in detection of pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} We prospectively evaluated {FDG} {PET/CT} studies obtained in patients with suspicion of operable pancreatic cancer between May 2006 and January 2008. Staging was conducted according to a standardized protocol, and findings were confirmed in all patients by surgical resection or biopsy examination.
{RESULTS:} Forty-five patients with a median age of 69 (range 22-82) were included in this study. Thirty-six had malignant tumors and nine had benign lesions (20\%). The sensitivity of enhanced versus unenhanced {PET/CT} in the detection of pancreatic cancer was 96\% versus 72\% (P=0.076), the specificity 66.6\% versus 33.3\% (P=0.52), the positive predictive value 92.3\% versus 80\% (P=0.3), the negative predictive value 80\% versus 25\% (P=0.2), and the accuracy 90.3\% versus 64\% (P=0.085).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Our preliminary data obtained in a limited number of patients shows that contrast-enhanced {FDG} {PET/CT} offers good sensitivity in the detection and assessment of pancreatic cancer, but at the price of a relatively low specificity. Enhanced {PET/CT} seems to be superior to unenhanced {PET/CT.} Further larger prospective studies are needed to establish its value for pre-surgical diagnosis and staging in pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} \& {AIMS:} Surveillance of high-risk groups for pancreatic cancer might increase early detection and treatment outcomes. Individuals with germline mutations in p16-Leiden have a lifetime risk of 15\% to 20\% of developing pancreatic cancer. We assessed the feasibility of detecting pancreatic cancer at an early stage and investigated the outcomes of patients with neoplastic lesions.
{METHODS:} Individuals with germline mutations in p16-Leiden (N = 79; 31 male; mean age, 56 years; range, 39-72 years) were offered annual surveillance by magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ({MRCP).} Those found to have neoplastic lesions were offered options for surgery or intensive follow-up. Individuals found to have possible neoplastic lesions were examined again by {MRI/MRCP} within 2 to 4 months.
{RESULTS:} After a median follow-up period of 4 years (range, 0-10 years), pancreatic cancer was diagnosed in 7 patients (9\%). The mean age at diagnosis was 59 years (range, 49-72 years). Three of the tumors were present at the first examination, and 4 were detected after a negative result in the initial examination. All 7 patients had a resectable lesion; 5 underwent surgery, 3 had an R0 resection, and 2 had lymph node metastases. Possible precursor lesions (ie, duct ectasias, based on {MRCP)} were found in 9 individuals (11\%).
{CONCLUSIONS:} {MRI/MRCP} detects small, solid pancreatic tumors and small duct ectasias. Although surveillance increases the rate of resectability, carriers of a p16-Leiden mutation develop aggressive tumors.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} Contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasonography ({CEH-EUS)} for the assessment of microcirculation and the delineation of pancreatic tumors in order to characterize and stage them has only recently become available for commercial use, and few reports have been published. The purpose of the study was the qualitative and quantitative digital image analysis of pancreatic adenocarcinomas using conventional endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS)} and {CEH-EUS} and the evaluation of whether contrast medium injection modified adenocarcinoma staging and patient management.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} In each of 30 prospectively examined patients with suspected pancreatic solid lesions, {CEH-EUS} was performed using the same quantity of the contrast agent {SonoVue} and a low mechanical index (0.3 - 0.4), followed by {EUS-FNA.} The histology, based on {EUS-FNA} or surgery and 9 months of follow-up, was: pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 15), pseudotumoral chronic pancreatitis (n = 12), neuroendocrine tumor (n = 1), common bile duct tumor (n = 1), lymph node metastases of gastric cancer (n = 1). The quantitative analysis was based on histograms obtained from each {CEH-EUS} video recording.
{RESULTS:} {CEH-EUS} showed a hypoenhanced pattern in 14 cases of adenocarcinoma and in 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis. The index of the contrast uptake ratio was significantly lower in adenocarcinoma than in mass-forming chronic pancreatitis. A cut-off uptake ratio index value of 0.17 for diagnosing adenocarcinoma corresponded to an {AUC} ({CI} 95\%) of 0.86 (0.67 - 1.00) with a sensitivity of 80\%, a specificity of 91.7\%, a positive predictive value of 92.8\%, and a negative predictive value of 78\%. The size of the pancreatic mass was assessed significantly more effectively by {CEH-EUS} but adenocarcinoma staging was not modified.
{CONCLUSION:} The majority of cases of both pancreatic adenocarcinoma and chronic pancreatitis were hypoenhanced and visual discrimination was not possible. This is the first study about {CEH-EUS} for the quantitative assessment of uptake after contrast injection which has shown that it can aid differentiation between benign and malignant masses but cannot replace {EUS-FNA.} Neither tumor stage nor therapeutic management have changed after contrast medium injection during {CEH-EUS.}},

{METHODS:} With institutional review board approval, radiographic, surgical, and pathological records of 203 consecutive patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were imaged with {MDCT} scanners using our institution's {CTA} pancreatic protocol. Images were compared with surgical outcomes to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of {MDCTA} in determining resectability.
{RESULTS:} Data were analyzed twice, once with equivocal findings on {MDCTA} assumed as resectable and again with equivocal cases assumed as unresectable. All equivocal cases were ultimately unresectable; when this was assumed, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were determined to be 100\%, 71\%, 85\%,100\% and 89\%. Twelve patients deemed resectable by preoperative {MDCTA} were found to be unresectable on surgical exploration owing to vascular involvement (n = 4), liver metastases (n = 4), and peritoneal involvement (n = 4).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} {EUS} can detect morphologic abnormalities of pancreatic cancer with high sensitivity but with limited specificity.
{OBJECTIVE:} To develop a classification model for differential diagnosis of pancreatic cancer by using a digital imaging processing ({DIP)} technique to analyze {EUS} images of the pancreas.
{DESIGN:} A retrospective, controlled, single-center design was used.
{SETTING:} The study took place at the Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.
{PATIENTS:} There were 153 pancreatic cancer and 63 noncancer patients in this study.
{INTERVENTION:} All patients underwent {EUS-guided} {FNA} and pathologic analysis.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} {EUS} images were obtained and correlated with cytologic findings after {FNA.} Texture features were extracted from the region of interest, and multifractal dimension vectors were introduced in the feature selection to the frame of the M-band wavelet transform. The sequential forward selection process was used for a better combination of features. By using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and other texture features based on separability criteria, a predictive model was built, trained, and validated according to the support vector machine theory.
{RESULTS:} From 67 frequently used texture features, 20 better features were selected, resulting in a classification accuracy of 99.07\% after being added to 9 other features. A predictive model was then built and trained. After 50 random tests, the average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer were 97.98 ± 1.23\%, 94.32 ± 0.03\%, 99.45 ± 0.01\%, 98.65 ± 0.02\%, and 97.77 ± 0.01\%, respectively.
{LIMITATIONS:} The limitations of this study include the small sample size and that the support vector machine was not performed in real time.
{CONCLUSION:} The classification of {EUS} images for differentiating pancreatic cancer from normal tissue by {DIP} is quite useful. Further refinements of such a model could increase the accuracy of {EUS} diagnosis of tumors.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Depression is highly prevalent in patients with pancreatic cancer and can result in fatal outcomes from suicides. The authors report suicide rates among patients with pancreatic cancer in the United States and identify factors associated with greater suicide rates.
{METHODS:} The current study reviewed data in the {SEER} database for patients diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma from 1995-2005. Logistic regression models were used to perform multivariate modeling for factors associated with suicide, while Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess factors affecting survival.
{RESULTS:} Among 36,221 patients followed for 22,145 person-years, the suicide rate was 135.4 per 100,000 person-years. The corresponding rate in the {US} population aged 65-74 years was 12.5 per 100,000 person-years, with a Standardized Mortality Ratio ({SMR)} of 10.8 (95\% {CI}, 9.2-12.7). Greater suicide rates were noted in males (Odds Ratio ({OR)} 13.5 [95\% {CI}, 3.2-56.9, P {\textless} .001]) and, among males, in patients undergoing an operative intervention ({OR} 2.5 [95\% {CI}, 1.0-6.5, P = .05]). Married men had a lesser risk of committing suicide ({OR} 0.3 [95\% {CI}, 0.1-0.6, P = .002]). Median survival among patients undergoing operative intervention was 2 months for those who committed suicide compared with 10 months for those who did not commit suicide.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Male patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma have a risk of suicide nearly 11 times that of the general population. Patients who undergo an operative intervention are more likely to commit suicide, generally in the early postoperative period.},

This number pertains to Europe, North America and parts of South America (Argentina). Men are more often afflicted than women (female:male ratio of about 1:1.5, though reports vary). There has been a very small but steady increase in the incidence over the last 50 years. Unfortunately, numbers for incidence and mortality are still practically identical for this cancer. The peak of incidence is between 60 and 80 years of age. In absolute numbers, there are 8,000 cases diagnosed annually in Germany, and 33,000 in the {US.} Pancreatic cancer at {\textless}40 years of age is extremely rare (2 cases per million per year), but among 80-year-olds, the incidence is about 200 new cases per 100,000 population per year. In men, carcinoma of the pancreas is the fourth most common cause of cancer death after lung, prostate and colorectal cancer. In women, it is the fifth most common cause of cancer death. Risk factors for pancreatic cancer include high-fat diet, smoking, chronic pancreatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, hereditary pancreatitis, family history of pancreatic cancer and diabetes mellitus. In chronic pancreatitis, the risk for pancreatic cancer is increased 20-fold, in hereditary pancreatitis it is 60-fold higher than in the general population. In a kindred with 2 first-degree relatives with pancreatic cancer, the risk for pancreatic cancer for other members of that kindred is 7-fold higher.},

{OBJECTIVE:} To prospectively assess the accuracy of the combination of {CEPD} and {RTSE} to differentiate pancreatic focal masses.
{DESIGN:} Cross-sectional feasibility study.
{SETTING:} A tertiary-care academic referral center.
{PATIENTS:} The study group included 54 patients with chronic pancreatitis (n = 21) and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 33).
{INTERVENTIONS:} Both imaging methods ({CEPD} and {RTSE)} were performed sequentially during the same {EUS} examination. Power Doppler mode examination was performed after intravenous injection of a second-generation contrast agent (2.4 {mL} of {SonoVue)}, and the data were digitally recorded, comprising both the early arterial phase and venous/late phase. Three 10-second sonoelastographic videos were also digitally recorded that included the focal mass and the surrounding pancreatic parenchyma. Postprocessing analyses based on specially designed software were used to analyze the {CEPD} and {RTSE} videos. A power Doppler vascularity index was used to characterize {CEPD} videos, the values being averaged during a 10-second video in the venous phase. Hue histogram analysis was used to characterize {RTSE} videos, with the mean hue histogram values being also averaged during a 10-second video.

{METHODS:} Temsirolimus (20 mg Kg(-1) daily) was administered to freshly generated pancreatic cancer xenografts. Tumour growth inhibition was determined after 28 days. Xenografts were characterised at baseline by gene expression and comparative genomic hybridisation. Patients with advanced, gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer were treated with sirolimus (5 mg daily). The primary end point was 6-month survival rate ({6mSR).} Correlative studies included immunohistochemistry assessment of pathway expression in baseline tumours, drug pharmacokinetics ({PKs)}, response assessment by {FDG-PET} and pharmacodynamic effects in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells ({PBMCs).}
{RESULTS:} In all, 4 of 17 xenografts (23\%) responded to treatment. Sensitive tumours were characterised by gene copy number variations and overexpression of genes leading to activation of the {PI3K/Akt/mTOR} pathway. Activation of {p70S6K} correlated with drug activity in the preclinical studies. Sirolimus was well tolerated in the clinic, showed predictable {PKs}, exerted pathway inhibition in post-treatment {PBMCs} and resulted in a {6mSR} of 26\%. No correlation, however, was found between activated {p70S6K} in tumour tissues and anti-tumour effects.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} \& {AIMS:} Qualitative endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} elastography is an accurate but subjective tool for the differential diagnosis of solid pancreatic masses. Second-generation {EUS} elastography allows quantitative analysis of tissue stiffness. We evaluated the accuracy of quantitative, second-generation {EUS} elastography in the differential diagnosis of solid pancreatic masses.
{METHODS:} The study included 86 consecutive patients who underwent {EUS} for the evaluation of solid pancreatic masses. {EUS} elastography was performed with the linear Pentax {EUS} and the Hitachi {EUB900.} Representative areas from the mass (A) and soft reference areas (B) were analyzed. The result of the elastographic evaluation was defined by the quotient {B/A} (strain ratio). Final diagnosis was based on histology of surgical specimens and cytology of {EUS-fine-needle} aspiration samples. The diagnostic accuracy of {EUS} elastography in detecting malignancy was calculated using receiver operating curve analysis.
{RESULTS:} The mean size of the pancreatic masses was 31.4 ± 12.3 mm. The final diagnoses were pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n = 49), inflammatory mass (n = 27), malignant neuroendocrine tumor (n = 6), metastatic oat-cell lung cancer (n = 2), pancreatic lymphoma (n = 1), and pancreatic solid pseudopapillary tumor (n = 1). The strain ratio was significantly higher among patients with pancreatic malignant tumors compared with those with inflammatory masses. The sensitivity and specificity of strain ratio for detecting pancreatic malignancies were 100\% and 92.9\%, respectively (area under the receiver operating curve, 0.983).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Quantitative, second-generation {EUS} elastography is useful for differential diagnosis of solid pancreatic masses. It allows for a quantitative and objective evaluation of tissue stiffness, which indicates the malignant or benign nature of the pancreatic lesion.},

{RESULTS:} A total of 636 lymph nodes were present in the 52 specimens examined for this study (12.2 lymph nodes per patient). Eleven patients had a {pN0} status, whereas 41 patients had lymph nodes that were positive for cancer. Five-hundred-twenty (82\%) lymph nodes were tumor-free, while 116 (18\%) showed metastatic involvement on histopathologic examination.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {STUDY} {AIMS:} Distinguishing pancreatic adenocarcinoma from other pancreatic masses remains challenging with current imaging techniques. This prospective study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of a new procedure, imaging the microcirculation pattern of the pancreas by contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasound ({CEH-EUS)} with a new Olympus prototype echo endoscope.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} 35 patients presenting with solid pancreatic lesions were prospectively enrolled. All patients had conventional B mode and power Doppler {EUS.} After an intravenous bolus injection of 2.4 ml of a second-generation ultrasound contrast agent ({SonoVue)} {CEH-EUS} was then performed with a new Olympus prototype echo endoscope ({xGF-UCT} 180). The microvascular pattern was compared with the final diagnosis based on the pathological examination of specimens from surgery or {EUS-guided} fine-needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} or on follow-up for at least 12 months.
{RESULTS:} The final diagnoses were: 18 adenocarcinomas, 9 neuroendocrine tumors, 7 chronic pancreatitis, and 1 stromal tumor. Power Doppler failed to display microcirculation, whereas harmonic imaging demonstrated it in all cases. Out of 18 lesions with a hypointense signal on {CEH-EUS}, 16 were adenocarcinomas. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value ({NPV)}, positive predictive value ({PPV)}, and accuracy of hypointensity for diagnosing pancreatic adenocarcinoma were 89 \%, 88 \%, 88 \%, 89 \%, and 88.5 \%, compared with corresponding values of 72 \%, 100 \%, 77 \%, 100 \%, and 86 \% for {EUS-FNA.} Of five adenocarcinomas with false-negative results at {EUS-FNA}, four had a hypointense echo signal at {CEH-EUS.}
{CONCLUSIONS:} {CEH-EUS} with the new Olympus prototype device successfully visualizes the microvascular pattern in pancreatic solid lesions, and may be useful for distinguishing adenocarcinomas from other pancreatic masses.},

{METHODS:} {DWI} and {MDCT} were performed in 31 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed, potentially resectable pancreatic tumors. {CT} images were obtained in the arterial and the portal venous phase. For {DWI}, a respiratory-triggered single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence (b values: 0, 300, and 600 s/mm(2)) was acquired. Images were analyzed in consensus by two radiologists blinded to the clinical data. Imaging results were correlated with intraoperative surgical and ultrasound findings as well as with results of histopathologic analysis and imaging follow-up.
{RESULTS:} Sensitivity and specificity in detecting liver metastases were 53.3\% and 77.8\% for {MDCT} and 86.7\% and 97.5\% for {DWI}, respectively. In our study population {DWI} would have changed the therapeutic management in 4 out of 31 patients (12.9\%) when compared to {MDCT.}
{CONCLUSION:} In the present pilot study, {DWI} performed significantly better than {MDCT} in the detection of liver metastases in patients with pancreatic tumors. Therefore, {DWI} may help to optimize therapeutic management in those patients in the future.},

	abstract = {X-ray computed tomography ({CT)} has been used for diagnoses of human pancreatic cancer. Although micro-{CT} is a useful approach to evaluate macromorphology of organs/tissue also in animal models, reports on pancreatic tumors are limited. In this study, the utility of micro-{CT} was assessed in characterizing chemically induced pancreatic tumors in Syrian hamsters. Hamsters treated with or without N-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine ({BOP)} were injected with the antispasmodic agent, scopolamine butylbromide, and contrast agents, 5 or 10 {mL/kg} body weight of iopamidol or Fenestra {VC} at 18-38 weeks, then examined by micro-{CT} scanning with a respiratory gating system. Both peristaltic and respiratory movements were substantially suppressed by the combination of scopolamine butylbromide treatment and the respiratory gating system, resulting in improvements of image qualities. Iopamidol clearly visualized the pancreatic parenchyma and contrasted the margins among the pancreas and other abdominal organs/tissue. Meanwhile Fenestra {VC} predominantly contrasted abdominal vascular systems, but the margins among pancreas and other organs/tissue remained obscure. Six pancreatic tumors of 4-13 mm in diameter were detected in four of 15 animals, but not the five tumors of 1-4 mm in diameter. The inner tumor images were heterogeneously or uniformly visualized by iopamidol and Fenestra {VC.} Overall, iopamidol could clearly contrast between pancreatic parenchyma and the tumors as compared with Fenestra {VC.} All tumors confirmed were histopathologically diagnosed as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. Thus, micro-{CT} could be useful to evaluate the carcinogenic processes and preventive methods of pancreatic cancer in hamsters and to assess the novel contrast agents for detection of small pancreatic cancer in humans.},

{METHODS:} Between October 2007 and September 2008, 22 {PET/CT} scans were performed using a dedicated {PET/CT} scanner in 21 patients with known or suspected pancreatic cancer. Follow up was used to reconcile discordance between {PET/CT} and {CSI.} The pre-{PET/CT} management plan and/or intent were prospectively recorded in all scans. The post-{PET/CT} management plan was determined from the medical record and/or discussions with treating clinicians. The management impact of {PET/CT} was classified as high, medium, low or none defined using Australian and New Zealand Association of Physicians in Nuclear Medicine {PET} data collection project criteria.
{RESULTS:} {PET/CT} and {CSI} were discordant in 14/22 (64\%: 95\% {CI;} 43-84\%) scans. Of the 14 discordant scans, {PET/CT} assessment was correct in eight, conventional imaging in four and there was insufficient information in two. Overall, {PET/CT} management impact was classified as high (n= 6), medium (n= 3), low (n= 9) or none (n= 4). Significant changes in management (high or medium impact) were induced by {PET/CT} in 9/22 scans (41\%: 95\% {CI;} 20-62\%) predominantly by correctly modifying the disease extent.
{CONCLUSION:} {PET/CT} has an incremental benefit over {CSI} and has a significant impact on management in patients with known or suspected pancreatic cancer. {PET/CT} merits consideration as part of the non-invasive evaluation of patients with known or suspected pancreatic cancer.},

{METHODS:} We reviewed the clinical {FDG-PET} data of 103 consecutive pancreatic cancer patients between July 2004 and March 2009.
{RESULTS:} The detection rates of pancreatic cancer by {MD-CT} (89\%) and {FDG-PET} (91\%) were similar. From the {MD-CT} findings, 38 patients were judged as operable, and 65, inoperable. Among the inoperable patients, noncurative factors (metastasis to the liver, peritoneum, remote lymph nodes, bones, and other organs and major arterial invasion) were detected by {MD-CT} and/or {FDG-PET.} Detection rates of liver metastasis and arterial invasion by {FDG-PET} were significantly inferior to those of {MD-CT} (neither was detected by {FDG-PET} alone). Remote lymph nodes and bone metastasis were detected in 20 lesions by {FDG-PET} alone; however, {MD-CT} indicated other noncurative factors in these patients. All 65 patients could be diagnosed as inoperable without {FDG-PET.}
{CONCLUSIONS:} {FDG-PET} is not a suitable imaging modality for either diagnosis or preoperative treatment in pancreatic cancer patients. Since it is expensive, {FDG-PET} as a routine diagnostic tool in pancreatic cancer patients must be used with caution.},

{MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS:} {US}, {CEUS} and 64-{CT} were performed in 49 consecutive patients with pancreatic head tumors and with suspected cancer. After evaluation 44 patients had pancreatic head adenocarcinoma and 5 had chronic pancreatitis, all confirmed by histology.
{RESULTS:} The sensitivity of {US}, {CEUS} and 64-{CT} for diagnosing malignant pancreatic head tumors was 89\%, 86\% and 93\%, respectively, and the overall accuracy was 82\%, 86\% and 88\% respectively. There was no significant difference in the malignant tumor size measurement between {US} and {CEUS} (p = 0.3619) or between {US} and 64-{CT} (p = 0.2129), but a significant difference was seen in the size measured by {CEUS} and 64-{CT} (p = 0.0197). The {CEUS} measurements on the tumor size were smaller. The overall accuracy for M staging of the patients who had surgery for adenocarcinoma was 86\% and 90\% for {US} + {CEUS} and 64-{CT}, respectively. By performing the {CEUS} and 64-{CT} we additionally found, respectively, 35\% and 45\% non-resectable patients of a group of patients, who were considered resectable on the primary radiological image material.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {CEUS} may be a useful diagnostic tool in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic head tumors. For the assessment of resectability {CEUS} did not prove useful. However, {CEUS} seemed very useful as an additional instrument in the detection of non-resectable patients already considered resectable on primary radiological image material.},

When {SM} does involve the pancreas, it can mimic pancreatic carcinoma both clinically and radiographically with pain, obstructive jaundice, a mass lesion, and even the appearance of vascular invasion. We report 6 patients with {SM} involving the pancreas (mean age 43.2 y, 5 female), and review their clinical presentation, radiographic findings, pathology, and outcome. Five of these 6 patients were originally thought to have a primary pancreatic neoplasm. Initial presenting clinical information was available for each patient: all 6 reported abdominal or epigastric pain, 3 reported weight loss, and 2 reported one or more of the following: back pain, fever, abdominal bloating/distention, nausea with/without vomiting, and anorexia. The lesions formed masses with an infiltrative pattern and all had 3 key histologic features: fibrosis, chronic inflammation, and fat necrosis-without a known etiology. The inflammatory infiltrate was composed of a mixture of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and scattered eosinophils. Of the 5 patients with post-treatment clinical information available, 4 had at least a partial response to treatment with steroids, tamoxifen, azathioprine, resection, or a combination of these, and 1 did not respond. A dramatic response to immunosuppressive therapy is illustrated by the case of a 46-year-old woman who presented with the presumptive diagnosis of an unresectable pancreatic cancer. Distinguishing {SM} from pancreatic carcinoma is crucial to appropriate management, as patients with {SM} may benefit from immunosuppressive therapy.},

{METHODS:} Between March 2006 and April 2008, 9 patients with pancreatic lipomas that were diagnosed by {CT} were reviewed in the present study. Clinical data and {CT} features of these 9 cases were retrospectively analysed. The patient population included 5 men and 4 women, aged 42-81 years (mean age, 65.8 years). The patients were followed up for at least 2 years with control {CTs.}
{RESULTS:} In all 9 cases, a well-bordered nodular fat density lesion was incidentally detected in the pancreas. Four of the lesions had a lobulated contour, and 2 of them had septations. Two of the lipomas were located in the head, 3 in the neck, 3 in the corpus, and 1 in the tail. The {CT} densitometric values were between -90 and -120 {HU}, with a mean value of -106 {HU.} No pancreatic or biliary dilatation or compression to the adjacent structures was seen. All the cases had control {CTs}, and the lipomas remained unchanged during the follow-up period. Histopathologic confirmation of the diagnosis was not planned for the cases.
{CONCLUSION:} Lipomas are rarely encountered in the pancreas. They often are diagnosed coincidentally as small, well-circumscribed, encapsulated, homogeneous, mature adipose masses on imaging studies. Imaging follow-up strategy or histopathologic confirmation is not necessary in asymptomatic patients.},

This process ensures proper cellular division that maintains {DNA} and chromosomal integrity and responds appropriately to external signals which communicate the level of demand for new cells. In cancer, genetic mutations leading to the overexpression of proteins which support cell cycle progression, or the downregulation of proteins involved in cell cycle inhibition contributes to the dysregulated cellular division and proliferation of malignant cells. The resulting uninhibited cellular proliferation provides ample opportunity for additional genetic mutations that lead to tumor progression. In the following review, we provide a brief introduction to the cell cycle and a discussion of the mechanism underlying the dysregulation of the cell cycle in human cancer.

The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of diagnosis of {PALN} by computed tomography ({CT)}, magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)}, and ({18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose} positron-emission tomography ({FDG-PET).}
{METHODS:} From August 2005 to July 2008, 119 patients with invasive ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were included in this study. {PALNs} with a longer diameter {\textgreater}10 mm on {CT} or {MRI} were suspected of being involved by metastasis, whereas {FDG} uptake exceeding that of the adjacent normal tissue was considered to be positive for metastasis on {FDG-PET} studies. The imaging findings were compared with the pathological diagnosis of {PALN} metastasis.
{RESULTS:} {PALN} dissection was performed in 71 patients (60.0\%). Although histopathological examination revealed metastasis in 6 patients (8.5\%), none of these patients was positive in any of the preoperative imaging studies. The longer diameter, the shorter diameter, the ratio of the two diameters, and the calculated lymph node volume showed no significant differences between patients with and without {PALN} metastasis.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Preoperative detection of {PALN} metastasis in patients with pancreatic cancer is very difficult. Intraoperative histopathological examination of frozen sections is necessary if radical resection is contemplated.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} The authors sought to determine the influence of two different iodine concentrations of nonionic contrast media (cm) on contrast enhancement in pancreatic computed tomography angiography ({CTA).}
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Sixty patients with clinically suspected or known pancreatic disease underwent pancreatic {CTA.} The patients were randomly assigned to group A (n = 30) and group B (n = 30). The contrast agent was injected with iodine concentrations of 400 mg I/ml (Iomeron 400) in group A and 300 mg I/ml (Iopamidol 300) in group B with the same total iodine dose (36 g). Arterial and portal venous phase contrast enhancement of the vessels, organs and pancreatic masses was measured, and blinded qualitative image assessment was performed by two expert radiologists.
{RESULTS:} In the arterial and portal venous phase, the highly concentrated cm led to significantly greater enhancement in the abdominal main vessels, pancreas and pancreatic carcinoma than did the low concentrated cm. No statistically significant attenuation differences were measured between pancreatic carcinomas and the pancreatic parenchyma in the arterial and portal venous phase between group A and B. The overall trend for both readers was to assign higher scores to group A than group B.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The higher iodine concentration leads to greater contrast enhancement of abdominal vessels and organs in pancreatic {CTA.} Detection and demarcation of hypovascular pancreatic carcinoma was not found to be improved by the higher iodine concentration.},

The {U.S.} Preventive Services Task Force ({USPSTF)} recommends against routine screening for pancreatic cancer in asymptomatic adults using abdominal palpation, ultrasonography, or serologic markers. The evidence for diet-based prevention of pancreatic cancer is limited and conflicting. Recommendations about lifestyle changes, such as stopping the use of tobacco products, moderating alcohol intake, and eating a balanced diet with sufficient fruit and vegetables is generally made. However, screening for persons with hereditary predisposition to develop pancreatic cancer has not been included in this review. Biomarkers represent one tool for the early detection of small, surgically resectable cancers in both the general and high risk populations. Some of the currently utilized biomarkers including carcinoembryonic antigen ({CEA)}, {CA} 19-9, {SPan-1}, and {DUPAN-2} unfortunately have yet to show the sensitivity and specificity needed to be used for screening asymptomatic patients in the general population for pancreatic cancer.

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Three major oncology centers reviewed their records and imaging examinations. Patients' history and demographics, primary tumor site and histology, presence of tumor recurrence, and presence and location of other metastases were reviewed.
{RESULTS:} Pancreatic metastases occurred in eight patients with alveolar {RMS.} Four of these presented at diagnosis and four with disease recurrence. In recurrent disease, the duration between the diagnosis of the primary tumor and pancreatic metastases varied from 8 months to 6 years (mean +/- {SD:} 2.38 +/- 2.49 years). In all patients who received {PET} scans, pancreatic metastases showed a marked {FDG-uptake}, but had variable detectability with {CT.} Pancreatic metastases were not associated with certain primary tumor locations or presence of other metastases, mandating an evaluation of the pancreas in all cases of alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas.

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is associated with a poor prognosis, and surgical resection remains the only chance for curative therapy. In the absence of metastatic disease, which would preclude resection, assessment of vascular invasion is an important parameter for determining resectability of pancreatic cancer. A frequent error is to misdiagnose an involved major vessel. Obviously, surgical exploration with pathological examination remains the "gold standard" in terms of evaluation of resectability, especially from the point of view of vascular involvement. However, current imaging modalities have improved and allow detection of vascular invasion with more accuracy. A venous resection in pancreatic cancer is a feasible technique and relatively reliable. Nevertheless, a survival benefit is not achieved by curative resection in patients with pancreatic cancer and vascular invasion. Although the discovery of an arterial invasion during the operation might require an aggressive management, discovery before the operation should be considered as a contraindication. Detection of vascular invasion remains one of the most important challenges in pancreatic surgery. The aim of this article is to provide a complete review of the different imaging modalities in the detection of vascular invasion in pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Young-onset cancer is a hallmark of many familial cancer syndromes, yet the implications of young-onset disease in predicting risk of pancreatic cancer among familial pancreatic cancer ({FPC)} kindred members remain unclear.
{METHODS:} To understand the relationship between age at onset of pancreatic cancer and risk of pancreatic cancer in kindred members, we compared the observed incidence of pancreatic cancer in 9040 individuals from 1718 kindreds enrolled in the National Familial Pancreas Tumor Registry with that observed in the general {US} population (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results). Standardized incidence ratios ({SIRs)} were calculated for data stratified by familial vs sporadic cancer kindred membership, number of affected relatives, youngest age of onset among relatives, and smoking status. Competing risk survival analyses were performed to examine the risk of pancreatic cancer and risk of death from other causes according to youngest age of onset of pancreatic cancer in the family and the number of affected relatives.
{RESULTS:} Risk of pancreatic cancer was elevated in both {FPC} kindred members ({SIR} = 6.79, 95\% confidence interval [{CI]} = 4.54 to 9.75, P {\textless} .001) and sporadic pancreatic cancer ({SPC)} kindred members ({SIR} = 2.41, 95\% {CI} = 1.04 to 4.74, P = .04) compared with the general population. The presence of a young-onset patient ({\textless}50 years) in the family did not alter the risk for {SPC} kindred members ({SIR} = 2.74, 95\% {CI} = 0.05 to 15.30, P = .59) compared with those without a young-onset case in the kindred ({SIR} = 2.36, 95\% {CI} = 0.95 to 4.88, P = .06). However, risk was higher among members of {FPC} kindreds with a young-onset case in the kindred ({SIR} = 9.31, 95\% {CI} = 3.42 to 20.28, P {\textless} .001) than those without a young-onset case in the kindred ({SIR} = 6.34, 95\% {CI} = 4.02 to 9.51, P {\textless} .001). Competing risk survival analyses indicated that the lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer in {FPC} kindreds increased with decreasing age of onset in the kindred (hazard ratio = 1.55, 95\% {CI} = 1.19 to 2.03 per year). However, youngest age of onset for pancreatic cancer in the kindred did not affect the risk among {SPC} kindred members.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Individuals with a family history of pancreatic cancer are at a statistically significantly increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer. Having a member of the family with a young-onset pancreatic cancer confers an added risk in {FPC} kindreds.},

The needle passed through the liver in one case (3\%). Nine passes (26\%) were made through the stomach.

Immediate and late follow-up {CT} images to detect complications were obtained.
{RESULTS:} Tumor tissues were obtained in nine pancreatic biopsies, and histologic specimens for diagnosis were obtained in all cases. One patient, who had a rare sarcomatoid carcinoma, received a second biopsy. One patient had a complication of transient pneumoperitoneum but no subjective complaints. An immediate imaging study and clinical follow-up detected neither hemorrhage nor peritonitis. No delayed procedure-related complication was seen during the survival period of our patients.

{PROCEDURE:} Forty-five patients previously treated for pancreatic cancer underwent {PET/CT} for suspected recurrence. Lesion status was determined on the basis of histopathology and radiological imaging follow-up.
{RESULTS:} Patient-based analysis showed that sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of {PET/contrast-enhanced} {CT} were 91.7\%, 95.2\%, and 93.3\%, respectively, whereas those of {PET/non-enhanced} {CT} were 83.3\%, 90.5\%, and 86.7\%, respectively, and those of enhanced {CT} were 66.7\%, 85.7\%, and 75.6\%, respectively. In 21 patients whom the final diagnosis was obtained from the histopathologic examination, those figures of {PET/contrast-enhanced} {CT} were 94.7\%, 50.0\%, and 90.4\%, respectively. The sensitivity of {PET/contrast-enhanced} {CT} in detecting local recurrence, abdominal lymph node metastasis, and peritoneal dissemination were 83.3\%, 87.5\%, and 83.3\%, respectively.
{CONCLUSION:} {PET/contrast-enhanced} {CT} is an accurate modality for assessing recurrence of pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Despite advances in imaging, differentiating benign from malignant causes of pancreatic duct dilation is difficult.
{OBJECTIVE:} The aim of our study was to assess the accuracy of the periductal hypoechoic sign ({PHS)}, defined as patchy hypoechoic areas adjacent to a dilated pancreatic duct, for the diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy.
{DESIGN:} Single-center, retrospective analysis.
{SETTING:} Tertiary care university hospital.
{PATIENTS:} All patients who underwent {EUS} from 2006 to 2008 for evaluation of pancreatic pathology were identified. Those with pancreatic duct dilation of 4 mm or more in the head of the pancreas or 3 mm or more in the body or tail were included. Digitally recorded {EUS} images were analyzed for {PHS} by 1 endoscopist blinded to final results. The final diagnosis was based on pathology results or clinical follow-up.
{RESULTS:} During the study period, 84 of 427 patients who underwent {EUS} for pancreas pathology had dilated pancreatic ducts. Of these, 42 patients had benign disease and 42 had pancreatic malignancy. The {PHS} was noted in 31 (73.8\%) of 42 patients with malignancy compared with 6 (14.3\%) of 42 patients with benign disease (P {\textless} .001). The {PHS} had a sensitivity of 73.8\%, a specificity of 85.7\%, and an accuracy of 79.8\% for the diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy. After adjusting for age, patients with the {PHS} were 17 times more likely to have a malignancy (odds ratio 16.66; 95\% {CI}, 5.01-55.44). Pancreatic duct diameter or dilation of both bile and pancreatic ducts were not predictive of malignancy.
{LIMITATION:} A retrospective design.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The {PHS} was an accurate and independent predictor of pancreatic malignancy in patients with a dilated pancreatic duct.},

{PATIENTS:} Forty-three patients underwent {EUS} of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and surrounding intra-abdominal and mediastinal lymph nodes (19 from a previous pilot study and 24 additional patients).
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} Midband fit, slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient from a linear regression of the calibrated {RF} power spectra were determined.
{RESULTS:} Discriminant analysis of mean pilot-study parameters was then performed to classify validation-study parameters. For benign versus malignant lymph nodes, midband fit and intercept (both with t test P {\textless} .058) provided classification with 67\% accuracy and area under the receiver operating curve ({AUC)} of 0.86. For diseased versus normal pancreas, midband fit and correlation coefficient (both with analysis of variance P {\textless} .001) provided 93\% accuracy and an {AUC} of 0.98. For pancreatic cancer versus chronic pancreatitis, the same parameters provided 77\% accuracy and an {AUC} of 0.89. Results improved further when classification was performed with all data.
{LIMITATIONS:} Moderate sample size and spatial averaging inherent to the technique.
{CONCLUSIONS:} This study confirms that mean spectral parameters provide a noninvasive method to quantitatively discriminate benign and malignant lymph nodes as well as normal and diseased pancreas.},

It has been shown to be an accurate tool in the diagnosis of congenital hyperinsulinism, but limited information is available on its value in adult disease. {OBJECTIVE}, {PATIENTS}, {AND} {DESIGN:} The objective of this study was to review our experience with {18F-FDOPA} {PET} imaging in six consecutive patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia ({HH)} (four solitary insulinomas, one diffuse beta-cell hyperplasia, one malignant insulinoma). {18F-FDOPA} uptake was also evaluated in 37 patients (43 procedures) without {HH} or other pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, which acted as a control group.
{RESULTS:} Using visual analysis, {18F-FDOPA-PET} proved positive in only one case (a multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 related insulinoma). In diffuse beta-cell hyperplasia, the pancreatic uptake was similar to controls. In the patient with liver metastases, the extent of disease was underestimated. The pancreatic uptake was not statistically different between controls and hyperinsulinemic patients. The main limitation for identifying insulinomas or beta-cell hyperplasia in adults appears to be to the {18F-FDOPA} uptake and retention in the whole pancreas. This drawback is potentially circumvented in focal hyperplasia in newborns due to a lower aromatic amino acid decarboxylase expression in the extralesional pancreatic parenchyma.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {18F-FDOPA} {PET} is of limited value in localizing pancreatic insulin secreting tumors in adult {HH.} Our results contrast with the referential study and require further analysis.},

All lesions were resected and underwent pathological examination assessing tumor differentiation as: undifferentiated (poorly differentiated) or differentiated (moderately and well differentiated). Mean vascular density ({MVD)} was also evaluated. {CEUS} enhancement and pathology were correlated (Spearman's test). Survival was analyzed with the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate analysis was performed with the Cox regression model. There were 30 differentiated and 12 undifferentiated adenocarcinomas at pathology. At {CEUS}, 10 lesions were poorly vascularized, whereas 32 lesions were well vascularized. Positive correlation was observed between {CEUS} groups and tumoral differentiation (rs=0.51; p=0.001) and between {CEUS} and {MVD} (rs=0.74; p{\textless}0.0001). Median survival in patients with group A vascularization at {CEUS} was significantly lower than in group B (p=0.015).

The performance of Tu-M2-{PK} was compared with that of {CA19-9} using cutoff values 15 and 37 {U/mL}, respectively.
{RESULTS:} The sensitivity of Tu-M2-{PK} and {CA19-9} in detecting {PDAC} was 55\% and 86\% at specificities of 52\% and 73\%, respectively. The area under the curve ({AUC)} of Tu-M2-{PK} was 0.55 and that of {CA19-9} was 0.84.

{METHODS:} We analyzed data collected from 51,529 male health professionals in a prospective cohort study. History of peptic ulcer disease was assessed at baseline in 1986 and updated biennially thereafter. Relative risks ({RRs)} and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs)} were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusting for smoking, body mass index, diabetes, and physical activity.
{RESULTS:} During 18 years of follow-up evaluation, we observed 274 incident pancreatic cancer cases. Compared with those with report of no peptic ulcer disease, men with gastric ulcer had an increased risk of pancreatic cancer ({RR}, 1.83; 95\% {CI}, 1.13-2.97). Although the risk was highest for those with a diagnosis of gastric ulcer that was close in time to the cancer diagnosis ({RR}, 3.66; 95\% {CI}, 1.45-9.24), the risk remained significantly increased 10-19 years after the gastric ulcer diagnosis ({RR}, 2.89; 95\% {CI}, 1.26-6.64).

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is the 5th leading cause of cancer-related death in Western countries. The 5-year survival rate is approximately 4\%, without significant changes over the last 50 years. This poor survival rate and bad prognosis are associated with the diagnosis of advanced-stage disease, which precludes the only potential curative treatment - surgical resection. In this setting, the main objective in the management of pancreatic cancer is to perform an early diagnosis and a correct staging of the disease. Endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS)} appears to be an essential tool for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer. {EUS} diagnostic accuracy for detecting pancreatic tumors ranges from 85 to 100\%, clearly superior to other imaging techniques. {EUS} accuracy for the local staging of pancreatic cancer ranges from 70 to 90\%, superior or equivalent to other imaging modalities. {EUS-guided} fine-needle aspiration allows a cyto-histological diagnosis in nearly 90\% of cases, with a very low complication rate. At present, the formal indications for {EUS-guided} fine-needle aspiration are the necessity of palliative treatment or whenever the possibility of neoadjuvant treatment is present. It could be also indicated to differentiate pancreatic adenocarcinoma from other pancreatic conditions, like lymphoma, metastasis, autoimmune pancreatitis or chronic pancreatitis.

A cutoff value for {CA} 19-9 (120 U/ml) was determined using a Cox proportional hazards model for survival.
{RESULTS:} Overall survival at 1, 3, and 5 years for patients with {CA} 19-9 {\textless} or = 120 U/ml was 76\%, 41\%, and 31\%, respectively, versus 64\%, 17\%, and 10\% for patients with {CA} 19-9 {\textgreater} 120 U/ml (p = 0.002). {CA} 19-9 {\textgreater} 120 U/ml was not associated, however, with a greater chance of an R1 or R2 resection (p = 0.86), tumor involving the {SMA} margin (p = 0.88), tumor at the portal vein groove (p = 0.14), or lymph node metastases (p = 0.89).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Our findings do not support a cutoff value for {CA} 19-9 that is associated with margin or lymph node involvement. Preoperative {CA} 19-9 {\textless} or = 120 U/ml is, however, associated with increased overall and recurrence-free survival.},

	abstract = {Several research groups have reported on the existence and in vitro characterization of multipotent stem-cells from the pancreas. However, the origin of these cells remains largely unexplained. Here, we report that in vitro culturing itself can turn adult cells from human exocrine pancreas into a cell population with typical stem cell characteristics. A simple, yet reliable method enabled us to track cell fates: Combining automated continuous observation using time-lapse microscopy with immunocytochemical analyses, we found that a significant fraction of the pancreatic cells ( approximately 14\%) can survive trypsination and displays a drastic change in the protein expression profile. After further cultivation, these cells give rise to a heterogeneous cell population with typical multipotent stem cell characteristics; i.e. they proliferate over long time periods and continuously give rise to specialized cells from at least two germ layers. Although we cannot exclude that a rare pre-existing stem cell-type also contributes to the final in vitro-population, the majority of cells must have been arisen from mature pancreatic cells. Our findings indicate that multipotent cells for regenerative medicine, instead of being laboriously isolated, can be generated in large amounts by in vitro de-differentiation.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} \& {AIMS:} Preoperative differential diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ({PDAC)} and focal masses in patients with chronic pancreatitis ({CP)} can be challenging. There are fine differences in the vascularization of these lesions; ultrasound contrast agents can aid in their differentiation. We evaluated the value of software-aided quantitative analysis of transabdominal contrast-enhanced ultrasonography for differential diagnosis of {PDAC} vs focal masses.
{METHODS:} Sixty patients for whom it was not possible to differentiate between an inflammatory focal lesion of the pancreas and a pancreatic carcinoma underwent contrast-enhanced ultrasonography with a second-generation contrast agent. Time-intensity curves were obtained for all exams in 2 regions of interest within the lesion and within the normal pancreatic tissue. Images were processed using Axius {ACQ} software; the following parameters were obtained: maximum intensity, arrival time, time-to-peak, and area under the curve. Absolute values and differences between the lesion and the normal tissue were evaluated.
{RESULTS:} Histology analysis revealed 45 {PDACs} and 15 inflammatory masses in patients with {CP.} Time-dependent parameters (arrival time and time to peak) were significantly longer in {PDACs} compared to focal masses. Although markedly lower than in healthy pancreata, the maximum intensity and area under the curve parameters were not significantly different between {PDACs} and focal lesions in patients with {CP.}
{CONCLUSIONS:} In cases of {CP}, {PDAC} and focal masses exhibit different perfusion patterns at a capillary level that can be visualized using the small microbubbles of ultrasound contrast agents. Contrast quantification software supplements a subjective visual assessment with objective criteria to facilitate the differential diagnosis of focal lesions in pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis.},

When the papilla cannot be traversed because of pyloric or duodenal stenosis, or the catheter cannot be introduced, or because of previous surgery, the usual alternative method is considered to be percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage ({PTBD).} We herein report our experiences with four cases with inoperable pancreatic head carcinoma associated with obstructive jaundice treated by endoscopic ultrasonography-guided biliary drainage ({EUS-BD).}
{METHODS:} Between September 2006 and December 2007, methods of {EUS-BD} were performed in four cases with inoperable pancreas head carcinoma. In three out of four cases, {EBD} and {PTBD} were unsuccessful because of previous surgery, or duodenal stenosis, or nondilated intrahepatic bile ducts. In one case, although {PTBD} was successful, internal drainage could not be established.
{RESULTS:} {EUS-BD} was successful for all cases. The obstructed biliary system was successfully decompressed by the creation of a choledochoduodenal fistula and the insertion of a transduodenal biliary plastic stent. No complication was encountered in all cases.

The apparent diffusion coefficient ({ADC)} values derived from {DWI} can distinguish between simple pancreatic cyst, inflammatory cysts, and cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. Presence of parenchymal fibrosis in chronic pancreatitis causes diffusion restriction and results in lower {ADC} values on baseline {DWI.} The {ADC} values reveal either delayed peak after secretin stimulation or lower peak values in patients with early chronic pancreatitis, which may be helpful to depict chronic pancreatitis in its earliest stage.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} We aimed to explore the predictive ability of preoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9 ({CA19-9)} and carcinoembryonic antigen ({CEA)} levels for assessing tumor resectability (R0 resection) in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
{METHODS:} The present study included 72 patients who had been treated surgically for potentially resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 42 patients who had been treated surgically for palliation (bypass surgery) at our institution. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma was histologically confirmed by pathological examination of the resected specimen or, if unresected, by intraoperative biopsy.
{RESULTS:} For resectable disease, the mean and median values of {CA19-9} were significantly lower than for R1/2 or unresectable disease. The best cut-off points for {CEA}, {CA19-9}, and tumor size to predict resectability were 2.47 {ng/mL}, 92.77 {U/mL} and 11.85 cm(3), respectively. A {CA19-9} {\textgreater} or = 92.77 {U/mL} and both tumor markers no less than the cut-off levels predicted the possibility of R1/2 or unresectability with 90.6\% and 88.6\% accuracy, respectively. However, either tumor marker or both tumor markers less than the cut-off levels predicted the probability of R0 resection only with 27.1\% and 40.6\% accuracy, respectively. The independent contributing factors to resectability (R0 resection) by multivariate regression analysis were a {CA} 19-9 {\textless} 92.77 {U/mL}, a tumor size {\textless} 11.85 cm(3), and a less advanced {AJCC} stage.
{CONCLUSION:} The present study demonstrates that preoperative serum {CA19-9} and {CEA} levels can be used for the prediction of resectability (R0 resection) in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which may enable a simple and cost-effective exclusion of such patients who are unlikely to benefit from surgery.},

{DESIGN:} Prospective, consecutive, descriptive study with a second blind evaluation of elastographic patterns for concordance analysis and use of a well-defined reference method for calculation of diagnostic accuracy.
{PATIENTS:} This study involved 130 consecutive patients with solid pancreatic masses and 20 controls with normal pancreases.

{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} Elastographic patterns of solid pancreatic masses and accuracy of the technique for malignancy.
{RESULTS:} Mean ({SD)} size of the masses was 30.9 (12.5) mm. The final diagnosis was malignant tumor in 78 patients, inflammatory mass in 42 patients, and neuroendocrine tumor in 10 patients. Four elastographic patterns were described, with a high concordance among 2 blinded investigators. A green-predominant pattern, either homogeneous or heterogeneous, excluded malignancy with a high accuracy. On the contrary, a blue-predominant pattern, either homogeneous or heterogeneous, supported the diagnosis of malignant tumor.

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2407-9-255},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Dramatic weight loss is an often underestimated symptom in pancreatic cancer patients. Cachexia- defined as an unintended loss of stable weight exceeding 10\%--is present in up to 80\% of patients with cancer of the upper gastrointestinal tract, and has a significant influence on survival. The aim of the study was to show the multiple systemic effects of cachexia in pancreatic cancer patients, in terms of resection rate, effects on pulmonary function, amount of fat and muscle tissue, as well as changes in laboratory parameters.
{METHODS:} In patients with pancreatic cancer, clinical appearance was documented, including the amount of weight loss. Laboratory parameters and lung-function tests were evaluated, and the thickness of muscle and fat tissue was measured with computed tomography scans. Statistical analysis, including multivariate analysis, was performed using {SPSS} software. Survival curves were calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test. To test for significant differences between the examined groups we used Student's t-test and the Mann-Whitney U test. Significance was defined as p {\textless} 0.05.
{RESULTS:} Of 198 patients with a ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, 70\% were suffering from weight loss when they presented for operation, and in 40\% weight loss exceeded 10\% of the stable weight. In patients with cachexia, metastases were diagnosed significantly more often (47\% vs. 24\%, P {\textless} 0.001), leading to a significantly reduced resection rate in these patients. Patients with cachexia had significantly reduced fat tissue amounts. Hence, dramatic weight loss in a patient with pancreatic cancer may be a hint of a more progressed or more aggressive tumour.
{CONCLUSION:} Pancreatic cancer patients with cachexia had a higher rate of more progressed tumour stages and a worse nutritional status. Furthermore, patients with cachexia had an impaired lung function and a reduction in fat tissue. Patients with pancreatic cancer and cachexia had significantly reduced survival. If weight loss exceeded 5\% there was a significantly reduced resection rate to detect, but the changes were significantly more substantial if weight loss was 10\% or more. We propose that a weight loss of 10\% be defined as significant in pancreatic cancer.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} A search of the radiology and {ERCP} databases at our institution for cases of annular pancreas in adults yielded the records of 42 patients who underwent 29 {ERCP}, 22 {CT}, and 13 {MRI} examinations. The {CT} and {MR} images were reviewed by two readers, and consensus agreement was reached regarding the shape of the pancreas, anatomic configuration of the ducts, and presence of disease. In addition, the degree of encirclement of the second part of the duodenum by the pancreatic head was evaluated in 24 patients with the {CT} or {MRI} finding of annular pancreas and in 30 control patients who were found not to have annular pancreas at {ERCP.}
{RESULTS:} Nine of 24 (37.5\%) cases of annular pancreas detected with {CT} or {MRI} did not have a radiologically complete ring of pancreatic tissue surrounding the second part of the duodenum. Three of the nine patients (33\%) with radiologically incomplete annular pancreas and six of the 15 patients (40\%) with complete annular pancreas had gastric outlet obstruction (p = 0.75). The presence of pancreatic tissue posterolateral to the second part of the duodenum had a high sensitivity (92\%) and specificity (100\%) for the presence of annular pancreas. The rates of pancreas divisum (37\%) and chronic pancreatitis (48\%) were high in this cohort.

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Seventy-nine patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas underwent three-phase enhanced {CT} with an individualized scan delay as determined by automatic bolus tracking (protocol 1) or an empiric scan delay (protocol 2). We evaluated enhancement of the aorta, portal vein, hepatic parenchyma, pancreatic parenchyma, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma during each phase. Two radiologists graded the conspicuity of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the pancreatic parenchymal phase. The results for the different groups were statistically compared.
{RESULTS:} Pancreatic parenchymal enhancement (mean ± standard deviation, 100.2 {HU} ± 17.6 vs. 88.5 {HU} ± 22.1; P {\textless} 0.05) and tumor-to-pancreas contrast (mean ± standard deviation, 75.3 {HU} ± 25.0 vs. 63.1 {HU} ± 24.1; P {\textless} 0.05) were significantly greater in protocol 1 than in protocol 2 during pancreatic parenchymal phase. Qualitative results correlated well with quantitative results (reviewer 1: R (s) = 0.78, P {\textless} 0.001; reviewer 2: R (s) = 0.66, P {\textless} 0.001)
{CONCLUSION:} The use of automatic bolus tracking with {MDCT} can significantly improve the degree of contrast enhancement in the pancreatic parenchyma and tumor-to-pancreas conspicuity.},

In this study, tumor resectability and residual tumor grading in patients evaluated by {MD-CT} (Multi-detector row {CT)} or by {SD-CT} (single-detector {CT)} were compared to determine whether more accurate imaging has a significant clinical impact on patient selection and surgical outcomes.
{METHODOLOGY:} One hundred-fifty consecutive patients with pancreatic cancer evaluated from January 2000 to April 2005 were included in this retrospective study. Seventy pancreatic cancer patients underwent pre-operative evaluation using {SD-CT} and angiography (5-7 mm slice thickness, 1st period 2000-2002), and 80 patients underwent {MD-CT} (1.25 mm slice thickness, 2nd period 2002-2005).
{RESULTS:} The introduction of {MD-CT} had a significant impact on the selection of suitable patients, this group showing a lower frequency of surgical intervention in cases of incurable disease (p = 0.0383). Pre-operative evaluation using {MD-CT} in the resected cases also provided a higher percentage of accurate {R0/R1} grading relative to {SD-CT} evaluations (p = 0.0164).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND/AIMS:} This retrospective study evaluated the suitability of computed tomography ({CT)} to detect malignancy while following patients with branch-type {IPMN}, most of which are benign and may be treated with observation alone.
{METHODOLOGY:} Forty-two surgical specimens resected from patients with a diagnosis of branch-type {IPMN} were pathologically classified as benign (n=26), which included hyperplasia and adenoma, or malignant (n=16), including moderate dysplasia or adenocarcinoma. It was compared the differences in the sizes of the tumor and main pancreatic duct ({MPD)} and the presence of mural nodules on {CT} between the groups.
{RESULTS:} In the malignant group, it was observed a larger tumor size (47.8 vs. 23.8 mm; p = 0.001) and increased dilation of the {MPD} (9.3 vs. 5.0 mm; p = 0.001) than those seen in the benign group. The accuracy of {CT} diagnosis of mural nodules, however, was only 62\%. Tumor diameter {\textgreater} or =40 mm or {MPD} diameter {\textgreater}10 mm predicted malignancy with a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 93.8\% and 95.7\%, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Either tumor size or {MPD} dilation detected by {CT} could predict the majority of malignant branch-type {IPMNs.} Increases in these morphological characteristics on {CT} images during the follow-up period would be an accurate method to predict a diagnosis of malignancy.},

	abstract = {{AIM:} To evaluate retrospectively the correlation between enhancement patterns on dynamic computed tomography ({CT)} and angiogenesis and fibrosis in pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
{METHODS:} Twenty-three patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma underwent dynamic {CT} and tumor resection. In addition to the absolute and relative enhanced value that was calculated by subtracting the attenuation value on pre-contrast from those on contrast-enhanced {CT} in each phase, we defined one parameter, "tumor-aorta enhancement ratio", which was calculated by dividing enhancement of pancreatic cancer by enhancement of abdominal aorta in each phase. These enhancement patterns were correlated with the level of vascular endothelial growth factor ({VEGF)}, microvessel density ({MVD)}, and extent of fibrosis.
{RESULTS:} The absolute enhanced value in the arterial phase correlated with the level of {VEGF} and {MVD} (P = 0.047, P = 0.001). The relative enhanced value in arterial phase and tumor-aorta enhancement ratio (arterial) correlated with {MVD} (P = 0.003, P = 0.022). Tumor-aorta enhancement ratio (arterial) correlated negatively with the extent of fibrosis (P = 0.004). The tumors with greater {MVD} and higher expression of {VEGF} tended to show high enhancement in the arterial dominant phase. On the other hand, the tumors with a larger amount of fibrosis showed a negative correlation with the grade of enhancement during the arterial phase.
{CONCLUSION:} Enhancement patterns on dynamic {CT} correlated with angiogenesis and may be modified by the extent of fibrosis.},

{METHODS:} We prospectively analyzed the association between intakes of fat, fat subtypes, and fat food sources and exocrine pancreatic cancer in the National Institutes of Health-{AARP} Diet and Health Study, a {US} cohort of 308 736 men and 216 737 women who completed a 124-item food frequency questionnaire in 1995-1996. Hazard ratios ({HRs)} and 95\% confidence intervals ({CIs)} were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models, with adjustment for energy intake, smoking history, body mass index, and diabetes.

{RESULTS:} Over an average follow-up of 6.3 years, 865 men and 472 women were diagnosed with exocrine pancreatic cancer (45.0 and 34.5 cases per 100 000 person-years, respectively). After multivariable adjustment and combination of data for men and women, pancreatic cancer risk was directly related to the intakes of total fat (highest vs lowest quintile, 46.8 vs 33.2 cases per 100 000 person-years, {HR} = 1.23, 95\% {CI} = 1.03 to 1.46; P(trend) = .03), saturated fat (51.5 vs 33.1 cases per 100 000 person-years, {HR} = 1.36, 95\% {CI} = 1.14 to 1.62; P(trend) {\textless} .001), and monounsaturated fat (46.2 vs 32.9 cases per 100 000 person-years, {HR} = 1.22, 95\% {CI} = 1.02 to 1.46; P(trend) = .05) but not polyunsaturated fat.

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board and did not require informed consent. {CT} images of pathologically proved ectopic pancreases (n = 14), {GISTs} (n = 33), and leiomyomas (n = 7) in the stomach and duodenum were retrospectively reviewed. Analysis of the {CT} findings included evaluation of the location, contour, growth pattern, border, enhancement pattern, and enhancement grade of the tumor, as well as the presence of surface dimpling, prominent enhancement of overlying mucosa, and low intralesional attenuation. The attenuation of each lesion, the long diameter ({LD)}, the short diameter ({SD)}, and the {LD/SD} ratio were measured. Among these findings, statistically significant variables were determined by using the chi(2) test (to compare the categoric variables), the Student t test (for quantitative analysis), and the receiver operating characteristic curve (to determine the optimal cutoff of the {LD/SD} ratio).
{RESULTS:} The typical location (prepyloric antrum and duodenum), endoluminal growth pattern, ill-defined border, prominent enhancement of overlying mucosa, and an {LD/SD} ratio of greater than 1.4 were found to be significant for differentiating ectopic pancreas from other tumors (P {\textless} .05 for each finding). When at least two of these five criteria were used in combination, the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing ectopic pancreas were 100\% (14 of 14) and 82.5\% (33 of 40), respectively. When four of these criteria were used, a sensitivity of 42.9\% and a specificity of 100\% were achieved.
{CONCLUSION:} By using specific {CT} criteria, ectopic pancreas can be differentiated from small {GIST} or leiomyoma with a high degree of accuracy.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} To review the current trends in pancreatic cancer research and propose alternatives for an earlier diagnosis.
{METHOD:} A search was conducted using the {PubMed} and Scielo electronic databases to find statistics related to the incidence of pancreatic cancer.
{RESULTS:} Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer mortality in the {USA;} in Colombia the incidence of this neoplasia is 4.5 per 100,000 individuals; and in Peru, amongst digestive diseases, it is the fifth most common cause. In Brazil and Chile this cancer has increased in incidence, while in Mexico, it has decreased in terms of the relative percentage of gastrointestinal cancers from 1976 to 2003. Chronic pancreatitis, cigarette smoking, diabetes, obesity and dietary mutagen exposure are the most consistent risk factors implicated in the development of pancreatic cancer; however, the genetic and molecular changes underlying the epidemiological association between these factors and pancreatic cancer remain largely unknown, and only 5-10\% are hereditary in nature.
{CONCLUSION:} The prognosis for pancreatic cancer has not changed substantially for at least the last 20 years. The most useful tumor marker for pancreatic adenocarcinoma is still the carbohydrate antigen 19-9 ({CA19-9).} Currently, a multimodal-screening approach of endoscopic ultrasound, computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography are the most effective methods to detect pancreatic cancer in high-risk patients. Future options for early detection of this malignancy are focused on new molecular markers, telomerase enzyme, receptor-targeted imaging using multifunctional nanoparticles, detection of glycan changes and epigenetics.},

{METHODS:} This is a retrospective analysis of a prospective database and included patients who underwent {EUS-FNA} at a university hospital for a focal pancreatic lesion noted on {CT/MRI.} Patients were excluded if (1) they had obstructive jaundice or (2) the lesion appear (seem)ed cystic on {CT/MRI.} The main outcome measurements were (1) prevalence of pancreatic cancer and (2) performance characteristics of {EUS-FNA} for identifying malignancy.
{RESULTS:} In the 213 study patients, a focal pancreatic lesion was identified in 173 patients by {EUS.} The final diagnosis included adenocarcinoma (n=89), neuroendocrine tumor (n=14), mucinous cystadenocarcinoma (n=1), solid pseudopapillary tumor (n=2), metastases (n=4), benign cyst (n=19), pseudocyst (n=9), abscess (n=4), chronic pancreatitis (n=32), and normal pancreas (n=39).

{METHODS:} Forty two consecutive patients (mean age 63 years; 25 men, 17 women) who had surgical exploration and histologically proved pancreatic cancer were retrospectively included. All our patients underwent with endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS)} and helical computed tomography (helical {CT).} Data analysis compared helical {CT}, {EUS} with the surgical data with or without histological study in diagnosis, staging and resectability of pancreatic cancer. Surgical findings were used as gold standard.
{RESULTS:} For positive diagnosis {EUS} was more sensitive 100\% ({CI:93-100)} than helical {CT} 88\% ({CI:77-95).} But helical {CT} was more specific 89\% ({CI:64-98)} than {EUS} 83\% ({CI:58-96)} for small tumors whose diameter is below 2.5 cm in witch {EUS} was more sensitive in their detection (100\% versus 83\%). In evaluating venous involvement {EUS} was more sensitive than helical {CT} (96\% versus 50\%; p{\textless}0.05), while {CT} was more specific (81\% versus 75\%; p{\textless}0.05). Regarding lymph nodes invasion, the two imaging technique had the same sensibility (56\%) with better specificity for helical {CT} (83\% versus 75\%; p{\textless}0.05).

The clinical and biological data and the {MR} imaging for 20 patients (11 female, 9 male; median age, 49 years) with cavernous transformation of the portal vein and no evidence of previous pancreatic disease were reviewed. The presence of pancreatic portal cavernoma (defined as intra- and/or peripancreatic portal cavernoma), morphological changes in the pancreas, biliary and ductal pancreatic abnormalities, and extension of the portal venous thrombosis were qualitatively assessed. Fifteen patients (75\%) had pancreatic portal cavernoma with collateral formation in the pancreas and/or collaterals around the pancreas seen on dynamic contrast-enhanced {MR} sequences: three patients had both intra- and peripancreatic portal cavernoma, six had intrapancreatic portal cavernoma alone and six had peripancreatic portal cavernoma only. The presence of intra- or peripancreatic portal cavernoma was significantly associated with extension of the thrombosis to the splenic and superior mesenteric veins (p = 0.05). Morphological changes in the pancreas, heterogeneity on T2-weighted sequences and main ductal pancreatic abnormalities were seen in two, four and two patients, respectively. All these patients had intrapancreatic portal cavernoma. Bile duct dilatation was observed in 13 (65\%) patients: among them three had extrahepatic dilatation only and these three patients had associated intrapancreatic portal cavernoma. In patients with cavernous transformation of the portal vein, intra- or peripancreatic portal cavernoma is common.

	volume = {15},
	issn = {1007-9327},
	abstract = {{AIM:} To evaluate the ability of endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} elastography to distinguish benign from malignant pancreatic masses and lymph nodes.
{METHODS:} A multicenter study was conducted and included 222 patients who underwent {EUS} examination with assessment of a pancreatic mass (n = 121) or lymph node (n = 101). The classification as benign or malignant, based on the real time elastography pattern, was compared with the classification based on the B-mode {EUS} images and with the final diagnosis obtained by {EUS-guided} fine needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} and/or by surgical pathology. An interobserver study was performed.
{RESULTS:} The sensitivity and specificity of {EUS} elastography to differentiate benign from malignant pancreatic lesions are 92.3\% and 80.0\%, respectively, compared to 92.3\% and 68.9\%, respectively, for the conventional B-mode images. The sensitivity and specificity of {EUS} elastography to differentiate benign from malignant lymph nodes was 91.8\% and 82.5\%, respectively, compared to 78.6\% and 50.0\%, respectively, for the B-mode images. The kappa coefficient was 0.785 for the pancreatic masses and 0.657 for the lymph nodes.
{CONCLUSION:} {EUS} elastography is superior compared to conventional B-mode imaging and appears to be able to distinguish benign from malignant pancreatic masses and lymph nodes with a high sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. It might be reserved as a second line examination to help characterise pancreatic masses after negative {EUS-FNA} and might increase the yield of {EUS-FNA} for lymph nodes.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} The aim of this study was to describe pancreatic involvement in von Hippel-Lindau ({VHL)} disease and to document the changes that occur in pancreatic lesions.
{METHODS:} We retrospectively analyzed the medical records and {CT} scans of 18 {VHL} patients who were diagnosed between 1994 and 2007 at the Samsung Medical Center. The clinical history with a detailed family history, biochemical test results, and imaging studies of the pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys were reviewed. Genetic analysis was performed in 12 patients. The changes in pancreatic lesions, such as an increase in cystic lesions, calcifications, and dilatation of the pancreatic duct, were analyzed in patients who had {CT} scans at least 1 year apart.
{RESULTS:} Pancreatic lesions existed in 89\% (16/18) of the patients. All 16 patients had multiple cystic lesions. Two patients had co-existing neuroendocrine tumors ({NET)}, and two patients had co-existing serous cystadenomas ({SCA).} At least one of three features of pancreatic lesions (cystic lesions, calcifications, and dilatation of the pancreatic duct) progressed in all nine patients who had {CT} scans 1 year apart.
{CONCLUSION:} Pancreatic involvement in {VHL} disease was relatively common in Korean patients. The most common type of pancreatic involvement was a multiple cystic lesion. {NET} and {SCA} existed in approximately 10\% of {VHL} patients with pancreatic involvement. Pancreatic lesions in {VHL} disease progressed, at least according to radiological images.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The deep-inspiration breath-hold F-fluorodeoxyglucose {PET/computed} tomography ({DIBH} F-{FDG} {PET/CT)} technique improves the limitations of diagnosing a lesion located in an area influenced by respiratory motion that brings about spatial misregistration caused by respiration between {PET} and {CT.} However, its clinical effectiveness with regard to abdominal lesions has not been elucidated. The influence of respiratory motion for calculating the maximal standardized uptake value ({SUVmax)} and metabolic volume ({MV)} in {DIBH} F-{FDG} {PET/CT} has not been investigated either.
{OBJECTIVE:} The purpose of this study was to investigate the usefulness of the {DIBH} F-{FDG} {PET/CT} technique in diagnosing liver tumors, bile duct cancers, and pancreas tumors. In addition, we compared the values of {SUVmax} and {MV} between {DIBH} and nonbreath-hold ({NBH).}
{METHODS:} Forty patients with various abdominal malignancies including liver tumors, bile duct cancers, and pancreas tumors were enrolled. In total, the patients had 47 abdominal lesions. All patients showed a misregistered image in the early whole-body image taken 50 min after intravenous F-{FDG} infusions. We added the delayed images 40 min after the first image. On the delayed image, we carried out both conventional techniques with normal respiration ({NBH)} and the {DIBH} technique. Finally, we compared two kinds of images in each patient. At the same time, we compared both {SUVmax} and {MV} of cancer obtained by the two kinds of imaging methods.
{RESULTS:} In 14 lesions (29.8\%), we corrected the anatomical tumor location, from the incorrect to the correct organ, by the {DIBH} technique. In 22 lesions (46.8\%), we corrected the tumor location within the organ. Consequently, tumor staging also changed in 11 patients (23.4\%) after correction by the {DIBH} technique. Regarding the {SUVmax} value by {DIBH}, it showed an increase of approximately 15.0-58.6\% compared with that measured by {NBH.} In contrast, the value of {MV} by {DIBH} showed a decrease of 20\% compared with that measured by {NBH.}
{CONCLUSION:} The {DIBH} F-{FDG} {PET/CT} technique is feasible for accurate localization when diagnosing of liver tumors, bile duct cancers, and pancreas cancers. The {DIBH} technique also improves the inaccurate quantification of both {SUVmax} and {MV.}},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:} Although changes of plasma fibrinogen have been documented in limited pancreatic malignant tumors, a relationship between plasma fibrinogen and pancreatic cancer in a large-scale clinical study has not been shown.
{METHODS:} Preoperative plasma levels of fibrinogen were retrospectively analyzed in 133 pancreatic cancer and 38 pancreatic benign tumor patients.
{RESULTS:} Plasma fibrinogen in pancreatic cancer patients were significantly higher than those with benign pancreatic tumor (3.99 +/- 1.01 vs 2.62 +/- 0.65; P {\textless} 0.001). The percentage of hyperfibrinogenemia ({\textgreater}4.20 {g/L)} in pancreatic cancer was 41.1\%, and no positive results were obtained in benign pancreatic disease. Plasma fibrinogen levels were increased in pancreatic cancer with advanced tumor stage. Accompanied with the progression of tumor stage, there was an increase in the percentage of positivity of hyperfibrinogenemia in pancreatic cancer. There were markedly higher levels of plasma fibrinogen in the distant-metastasis group than in the no-distant-metastasis group (4.41 +/- 0.84 vs 3.76 +/- 1.04; P {\textless} 0.01). Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed that high plasma fibrinogen levels ({\textgreater}4.20 {g/L)} were positively associated with distant metastasis of pancreatic cancer.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Plasma fibrinogen levels had a positive relationship with tumor stage of pancreatic cancer. Increased preoperative plasma fibrinogen levels might be a useful predictor for distant metastasis in human pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} In many centers, on-site cytopathologists are not available during {EUS-guided} {FNA} ({EUS-FNA)} examinations. Often, endosonographers request that technologists assess the adequacy of {FNA} by gross inspection of the slides. To date, there has not been a study that assessed the accuracy of experienced technologists in predicting tissue sampling adequacy by gross inspection before cytologic staining.
{OBJECTIVES:} To assess a grading system used by cytotechnologists and {EUS} technologists during gross inspection of {FNA} slides in reliably predicting specimen adequacy compared with the final cytologic diagnoses.
{DESIGN:} Prospective, double-blind, controlled study.
{SETTING:} Academic tertiary-referral center with a high-volume {EUS} practice.
{PATIENTS:} Fifty-one patients with a suspected solid pancreatic mass who were undergoing planned {EUS-FNA.}
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} The degree of correlation in the assessment of specimen adequacy as exhibited by a weighted kappa statistic between 2 groups of technologists and a board-certified cytopathologist.
{RESULTS:} {FNA} was performed in 37 cases with 234 individual slide specimens available for analysis. Only fair agreement was observed between cytotechnologists and {EUS} technologists versus final cytopathologic assessment of adequacy (kappa 0.20 and 0.19, respectively). The routine practice of 6 to 7 {FNA} passes yielded adequate tissue for assessment in 36 of 37 patients (97\%).
{LIMITATIONS:} Interobserver variability, single center, and findings applicable only to solid pancreatic lesions.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Neither trained {EUS} technologists nor cytotechnologists were able to provide a reliable assessment of pancreatic-mass {FNA} adequacy by using gross visual inspection of the specimen on a slide. Rapid on-site cytopathology reduced the number of passes, ensured specimen adequacy, provided definitive diagnosis, and should be used in centers where available.},

{RESULTS:} Probability of {PC} was associated with jaundice [odds ratio ({OR)} 2.89; confidence interval ({CI)} 1.71-4.85], glycemic disturbance ({OR} 5.64; {CI} 2.36-13.46), tobacco index {\textgreater}20 ({OR} 2.11; {CI} 1.08-4.09) and tumour marker {CA} 19-9 ({OR} 9.33; {CI} 1.36-63.95).

	issn = {1499-3872},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease with an increasing incidence. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data on diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic head carcinoma, and analyzed the factors affecting prognosis of the disease.
{METHODS:} The data of 189 patients with pancreatic head carcinoma treated from September 1, 1995 to August 31, 2005 were reviewed retrospectively. Ninety-four patients treated from September 1, 2000 to August 31, 2005 were followed up in April 2008. The median survival time ({MST)} and 1- to 5- year cumulative survival rates of the patients were calculated by the life table method and the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression was used to screen out significant risk factors.
{RESULTS:} 96.9\% of the patients were more than 40 years old, and the male/female ratio was 1.63. The detection rate of transabdominal ultrasonography ({US)}, computed tomography ({CT)}, endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS)}, and serum tumor marker {CA19-9} were 82.0\%, 93.1\%, 94.7\% and 79.8\%, respectively. The {MST} of patients with pancreatic head carcinoma was 360+/-60 days. The 1- to 5-year cumulative survival rates were 50.0\%, 19.2\%, 12.1\%, 9.4\% and 4.7\%, respectively. However, patients with unresectable tumor survived for a shorter time (183+/-18 days). Their 1- to 2-year cumulative survival rates were 28.3\% and 0.0\%. Cox regression analysis showed that in pancreatic head carcinoma, the independent predictors for prognosis included tumor size, invasion of the superior mesenteric vessel, and radical resection. The {MST} of patients with pancreatic head carcinoma after radical resection was 510 days, significantly longer than that of patients undergoing non-specific treatment and palliative therapy (225 days). In addition, patients with slight jaundice survived for the longest time (533+/-51 days), compared with patients with severe jaundice (236+/-43 days) and without jaundice (392+/-109 days).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Pancreatic head carcinoma is easily misdiagnosed, and is usually found to be advanced when tumor size is too large (above 4 cm in diameter) with local spread or metastatic disease. In these cases, surgical resection is usually not feasible, and its prognosis is usually very poor. Therefore, careful attention should be paid to these high-risk patients, especially, males, more than 40 years old, and presenting slight jaundice. Then imaging examination ({US}, {CT} and {EUS)} and serum tumor marker examination ({CA19-9)} are used to detect this disease earlier, and perform curative resection earlier. In this way, it is possible to cure the patients with a longer survival time and better quality of life.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} The objective of this study was to assess the ability to detect pancreatic metastasis of lung cancer and to clarify the degree of fluorodeoxyglucose ({FDG)} accumulation and computed tomography ({CT)} characteristics of pancreatic metastasis from lung cancer.
{METHODS:} A total of 573 patients (415 men and 158 women) with lung cancer were retrospectively evaluated. All patients underwent {FDG-positron} emission tomography ({PET)/CT} with contrast-enhanced {CT} for first=stage (313 patients; initial study group) or follow-up study (260 patients; follow-up study group). A lesion was regarded as positive for metastasis on the basis of visual judgment of the degree of increased metabolism by two experienced and independent interpreters, supported by semiquantitative evaluation on the basis of calculation of the maximum standardized uptake value ({SUV(max)).}
{RESULTS:} Abnormal accumulations in the pancreas were detected in 5 of 313 patients (1.60\%) in the initial study group, and 6 of 260 patients (2.31\%) in the follow-up study group. Seven of these patients had adenocarcinoma, three had small cell carcinoma, and the rest had large cell endocrine carcinoma. Tumor sizes (longitudinal diameter), measured by {CT}, of these 11 patients ranged from 6 mm to 52 mm (mean +/- {SD} 8.3 mm +/- 11.9 mm), and {SUV(max)} for 1 h ranged from 3.37 to 11.1 (mean +/- {SD} 6.12 +/- 2.43). Three of these pancreatic lesions were difficult to determine by routine transaxial images, and detection was obvious only by thin-slice images or multiplanar reconstruction images. Contrast-enhanced {CT} showed gradual fill-in from the peripheral portion to the center. In addition, 10 of 11 cases did not show main pancreatic duct dilatation even if the tumor size was large.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Metastases to the pancreas in lung cancer patients are not so rare and radiologists first have an important role to detect the pancreatic mass and then suggest to metastasis as the likely diagnosis. For this purpose, {FDG-PET/CT} has an advantage in depicting unsuspected pancreatic metastasis from lung cancer, particularly that which is not detected by {CT} alone.},

None had a history of alcohol abuse or preexisting pancreatitis of any kind. On {EUS}, tumors tended to be large, with a mean diameter of 47 mm (range 20-70 mm). All tumors had a heterogeneous echotexture and a distinct appearance when compared with the typical appearance of adenocarcinoma when viewed via {EUS.} The diagnosis of giant cell tumor of the pancreas, as well as the subtype, was made via {EUS-guided} {FNA} of the pancreatic lesion. Patients with pleomorphic giant cell tumors of the pancreas had a poor clinical course with a rapid decline, whereas those with mixed or osteoclastic giant cell tumors tended to have a better outcome, with a greater long-term survival. One patient is still alive more than 18 months after diagnosis.
{LIMITATION:} Retrospective study.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Giant cell tumors of the pancreas have unique clinical, endoscopic, and cytologic features. The risk factors for these lesions may be different from those associated with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Some giant cell tumor subtypes may carry a more favorable prognosis than pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and awareness and recognition of these differences can affect patient care.},

	abstract = {Endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS)} was introduced about 25 years ago with the primary aim of better visualization of the pancreas as compared to transabdominal ultrasonography. This review discusses the current evidence in 2008 concerning the role of {EUS} in the clinical management of patients, with a special emphasis on its impact on surgical therapy. According to the literature, good indications are detection of common bile duct stones (e.g. in acute pancreatitis), the detection of small exo- and endocrine pancreatic tumors, the performance of fine-needle aspiration in pancreatic masses depending on therapeutic consequences. In other areas such as diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis and cystic pancreatic lesions, the contribution of {EUS} seems limited. Pancreatic cancer staging is discussed controversially due to conflicting evidence and certainly has lost grounds due to improvements in {CT} technology. Therapeutic {EUS} is, however, more widely accepted and may replace other techniques, e.g. in pancreatic cyst drainage and celiac plexus neurolysis; further techniques of interest are being developed.},

{METHODS:} The clinical and ultrasonic characteristics of 12 cases of pancreatic lymphoma and 30 cases of pancreatic cancer were retrospectively analyzed.
{RESULTS:} Statistically significant differences were found in the course of disease, back pain, jaundice, carcino-embryonic antigen ({CEA)} and {CA19-9} increase, palpable abdominal lump, superficial lymph node enlargement, fever and night sweats, lesion size, bile duct expansion, pancreatic duct expansion, vascular involvement, retroperitoneal (below the renal vein level) lymph node enlargement, and intrahepatic metastasis between pancreatic lymphoma and pancreatic cancer. There were no significant differences in age of onset, gender ratio, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, lesion position, the echo of the lesion, and the blood flow of the lesion.
{CONCLUSION:} Pancreatic lymphoma should be considered for patients with long lasting symptoms, superficial lymph node enlargement, palpable abdominal lump, fever and night sweats, relatively large lesions, and retroperitoneal (below the level of the renal vein) lymph node enlargement. A diagnosis of pancreatic cancer should be considered more likely in the patients with relatively short disease course, jaundice, back pain, {CEA} and {CA19-9} increase, relatively small lesions, bile duct expansion, obvious pancreatic duct expansion, peripheral vascular wrapping and involvement, or intrahepatic metastases.},

{RESULTS:} The 25-gauge {EUS-FNA} was technically easier and obtained superior overall diagnostic accuracy than the 22-gauge and Trucut needles, especially in lesions of the pancreas head and uncinate process. Overall accuracy for the 25-gauge, 22-gauge and Trucut needle was 91.7\%, 79.7\% and 54.1\%, respectively. Accuracy for cytological diagnosis irrespective the site of lesions with 25-gauge, 22-gauge and Trucut needles was 91.7\%, 75.0\%, and 45.8\%, respectively. For uncinate masses, it was 100\%, 33.3\%, and 0.0\%, respectively. These differences were significant.

{CONCLUSIONS:} The 25-gauge {FNA} needle was significantly superior in terms of technical success rate and overall diagnostic accuracy, especially for the head and uncinate lesions, compared to the 22-gauge and Trucut needles and could be considered 'the best choice needle for cytological diagnosis' of solid pancreatic lesions.

	abstract = {Optical coherence tomography ({OCT)} is an optical imaging modality that performs high-resolution, cross-sectional, subsurface tomographic imaging of the microstructure of tissues. The physical principle of {OCT} is similar to that of B-mode ultrasound imaging, except that it uses infrared light waves rather than acoustic waves. The in vivo resolution is 10-25 times better (about 10 microns) than with high-frequency ultrasound imaging, but the depth of penetration is limited to 1-3 mm, depending upon tissue structure, depth of focus of the probe used, and pressure applied to the tissue surface. In the last decade, {OCT} technology has evolved from an experimental laboratory tool to a new diagnostic imaging modality with a wide spectrum of clinical applications in medical practice, including the gastrointestinal ({GI)} tract and pancreatic-biliary ductal system. {OCT} imaging from the {GI} tract can be done in humans by using narrow-diameter, catheter-based probes that can be inserted through the accessory channel of either a conventional front-view endoscope, for investigating the epithelial structure of the {GI} tract, or a side-view endoscope, inside a standard transparent {ERCP} catheter, for investigating the pancreatico-biliary ductal system. Esophagus and the esophago-gastric junction has been the most widely investigated organ so far; more recently, also duodenum, colon and pancreatico-biliary ductal system have been extensively investigated. {OCT} imaging of the gastro-intestinal wall structure is characterized by a multiple-layer architecture that permits an accurate evaluation of the mucosa, lamina propria, muscularis mucosae, and part of the submucosa. The technique may be, therefore, used to identify pre-neoplastic conditions of the {GI} tract, such as Barrett's epithelium and dysplasia, and evaluate the depth of penetration of early-stage neoplastic lesions. {OCT} imaging of the pancreatic and biliary ductal system could improve the diagnostic accuracy for ductal epithelial changes and the differential diagnosis between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions.},

{METHODS:} {FDG-PET} was performed in 56 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent curative surgery. The standardized uptake value ({SUV)} for {FDG} was calculated in each patient and the relationships between the {SUV} and various clinicopathological factors were analyzed.
{RESULTS:} The tumors ranged from 0.8 to 6.5 cm in diameter. When the cutoff value for the {SUV} was set at 2.5, 51 of the 56 patients (91\%) had a positive {FDG-PET} study. The {SUV} did not show a significant difference in relation to tumor differentiation or {pTS} and {pT} factors. There was also no correlation between the {SUV} and the maximum tumor diameter (r = 0.22; P = 0.1).

We hypothesized that due to frequent asymmetric growth pattern, as well as somewhat diffuse margins of pancreatic cancer, the use of {WHO} vs. {RECIST} criteria may result in significantly different tumor response assessments. The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare the {WHO} (bidimensional) to {RECIST} (unidimensional) in assessing treatment response in pancreatic cancer patients enrolled in clinical trials.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} We have evaluated the contrast- enhanced computed tomography ({CT)} images from 12 pancreatic cancer patients with measurable disease enrolled in two phase {I/II} clinical trials at the Arizona Cancer Center, between July 2000 and July 2003. The tumor measurements were re-calculated by {RECIST} and {WHO} criteria and were compared.
{RESULTS:} In 3 out of the 12 patients (25\%) there was discordant response categorization when {WHO} criteria were used instead of {RECIST.} Clinical presentations in all 3 patients were more consistent with {WHO} categorization.

The aim of this review is to describe the current role of endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} for the diagnosis and staging of patients with pancreatic cancer.

Despite progress made with other imaging methods, {EUS} is still considered to be superior for the detection of clinically suspected lesions, especially if the results of other cross-sectional imaging modalities are equivocal. The major advantage of {EUS} is the high negative predictive value that approaches 100\%, indicating that the absence of a focal mass reliably excludes pancreatic cancer. The introduction of {EUS-guided} fine needle aspiration allows a preoperative diagnosis in patients with resectable cancer, as well as a confirmation of diagnosis before chemoradiotherapy for those that are not.

	abstract = {Recently, p-[({123)I]iodo-L-phenylalanine} ({IPA)} was clinically validated for brain tumour imaging. Preclinical studies demonstrated uptake of {IPA} into pancreatic adenocarcinoma suggesting its diagnostic application in patients with pancreatic tumours. The aim was to study the tumour uptake of {IPA} in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and to analyse its biodistribution and dosimetry to assess the radiation dose resulting from its diagnostic use.
{PATIENTS}, {METHODS:} Seven patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma underwent whole-body scintigraphies and {SPECT} up to 24 h after administration of 250 {MBq} of {IPA.} Tumour uptake of {IPA} was assessed visually. Time activity curves and the corresponding residence times were determined for whole-body, kidneys, liver, spleen, lung, heart content, brain, and testes. Mean absorbed doses for various organs and the effective dose were assessed based on the {MIRD} formalism using {OLINDA/EXM.}
{RESULTS:} {IPA} exhibited no accumulation in proven manifestations of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. {IPA} was exclusively eliminated by the urine and showed a delayed clearance from blood. Residence times were 0.26 +/- 0.09 h for kidneys, 0.38 +/- 0.19 h for liver, 0.15 +/- 0.07 h for spleen, 0.51 +/- 0.20 h for lungs, 0.22 +/- 0.07 h for heart content, 0.11 +/- 0.05 h for brain, 0.014 +/- 0.005 h for testes and 6.4 +/- 2.2 h for the remainder. The highest absorbed doses were determined in the urinary bladder wall and in the kidneys. According to the {ICRP} 60 the effective dose resulting from 250 {MBq} {IPA} was 3.6 +/- 0.7 {mSv.}
{CONCLUSION:} Para-[({123)I]iodo-L-phenylalanine} can be used in diagnostic nuclear medicine with acceptable radiation doses. Besides its proven validity for brain tumour imaging, {IPA} does not appear to be suitable as tracer for pancreatic cancer.},

After the therapy, local treatment response was evaluated by dynamic {CT} calculating the maximum area of the tumor, by comparing it with its size in pre- therapy. Subjects who had at least a 50\% or more decrease of tumor size lasting more than 4 wk were estimated as partial response ({PR)}, more than a 50\% of increase progressive disease ({PD)} and if neither {PR} nor {PD} criteria were met, they were classified as stabled disease ({SD).} Next, {EU} scores were compared with {IMD}, {AVD}, {VEGF} and treatment response. Statistically significant differences were evaluated by Pearson's correlation, post-hoc, Spearman's rank correlation, Wilcoxon rank sum and Student's t-test. A p {\textless} 0.05 was defined as being statistically significant. Before the therapy, the {EU} score and {IMD} were significantly correlated (r = 0.50, p {\textless} 0.02), as was {VEGF} (r = 0.45, p {\textless} 0.05). The {EU} score and {AVD} were negatively correlated (r = - 0.56, p {\textless} 0.02). Significant correlation was found between the {EU} score and histological grading (p {\textless} 0.004). The {EU} score was higher in subjects who had hepatic metastasis compared with subjects who had no hepatic metastasis (p {\textless} 0.05). After chemoradiotherapy, 14 subjects exhibited {PR}, while 13 showed {SD.} None of the subjects showed {PD.} The {EU} score was smaller in {PR} than {SD} (p {\textless} 0.05). The {EU} score significantly decreased after the therapy in {PR} (p {\textless} 0.01) but not in {SD.} {IMD} and {AVD} did not significantly decrease in either {PR} or {SD;} however, {VEGF} decreased significantly in {PR} (p {\textless} 0.01) but not in {SD.} Contrast-enhanced {US} could reveal tumor vascularity of pancreatic ductal carcinoma and could be potentially useful to evaluate treatment effect of subjects who receive chemoradiotherapy. Further investigation will be needed to prove the usefulness of contrast-enhanced {US.}},

{AIM:} The present paper aims to assess the diagnostic accuracy of radial {EUS} in the staging of pancreatic cancer as well as the role of {EUS} to predict tumor resectability.
{MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS:} 30 patients (22 males, 8 females, mean age 61 +/- 12 years) with pancreatic masses staged by both radial {EUS} and surgery (17 patients with intraoperative exploration and 13 with pathological examination of surgical specimens) and with histologically proved adenocarcinoma were included in the study. Surgical examination was indicated in patients with pancreatic masses evidenced by imaging methods other than {EUS}, without distant metastases proved preoperatively, and without taking into consideration the staging obtained by {EUS.} Resectability criteria for pancreatic tumors as assessed by {EUS} were invasion of superior mesenteric artery or invasion of celiac trunk.
{RESULTS:} The accuracy of {EUS} T staging was 86.6\%, that of N staging was 93.3\% while that of the vascular invasion was 80\%. The accuracy of {EUS} for predicting tumor stage had a direct impact on the assessment of tumor resectability (83.3\%, {CI} 95\%: 81.5- 85.2). It had a sensitivity of 100\%, specificity of 75\%, {PPV} of 91.6\% and {NPV} of 100\%.
{CONCLUSION:} The radial {EUS} of the pancreas is an accurate method for tumor staging. For establishing tumor resectability, association with other imaging methods is advisable for arterial assessment.},

The objective of this study was to investigate prospectively in a general medical hospital the incidence, causes and clinical impact of hyperamylasaemia and/or hyperlipasaemia in these patients.
{MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS:} During a 4-month period in 2004, amylase and lipase activities were measured in all patients (n, 1765) admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine of the Municipal Clinic of Lüneburg, Germany. Patients with increased enzyme activities underwent abdominal ultrasonography and, if inconclusive, other imaging procedures.
{RESULTS:} Amylase and/or lipase activities were increased in 140 (8\%) patients with non-pancreatic diseases: amylase in 29 cases (21\%) and 1 case (1\%){\textless}3 and{\textgreater}3 times the upper limit of normal, respectively, lipase in 120 cases (86\%) and 6 cases (4\%){\textless}3 and{\textgreater}3 times, respectively. In 53 (38\%) patients no further imaging studies could be performed. In the remaining 87 patients amylase was increased in 18 patients (21\%) and lipase in 3 patients (3\%). The pancreas was normal on imaging procedures in 77 (89\%) patients and abnormal in 10 (11\%) (chronic pancreatitis: 4, small cystic lesions: 6). The cystic lesions were mostly located in the pancreas head, probably corresponding to branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Increased pancreatic enzyme activities occur in 8\% of hospitalized patients with non-pancreatic diseases, but pancreatic abnormalities will be found in only a few (11\%), which are unlikely to need further investigation or therapy. Therefore, routine analysis of amylase or lipase activities in patients with non-pancreatic diseases is not indicated.},

	abstract = {To evaluate if contrast-enhanced ultrasonography ({CEUS)} improves the depiction of tumoral margins of pancreatic adenocarcinoma in relation to tumor enhancement, using pathology as criterion standard.
{METHODS:} Two hundred forty-one patients affected by pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were investigated at {CEUS} with a second-generation contrast medium of sulfur-hexafluoride microbubbles. Sixty-seven (27.8\%) of 241 tumors were resected. By consensus, 2 radiologists reviewed the {CEUS} examination results of the 67 tumors judging the enhancement as low (hypovascular lesions, hypoechoic tothe adjacent parenchyma) or high (iso- or hypervascular lesions, iso- or hyperechoic to the adjacent parenchyma). The resected tumors were evaluated at pathology for the presence of positive neoplastic (R+) or negative neoplastic (R-) resected margins.
{RESULTS:} Of the 67 resected tumors, 35 (52.3\%) were R-, whereas 32 (47.7\%) were R+. Moreover, at {CEUS}, of the 67 resected tumors, 43 (64.1\%) were hypovascular with low enhancement and 24 (35.8\%) were iso-hypervascular with high enhancement. In the R- group, 27 (77.1\%) of 35 tumors were hypovascular. In the R+ group, 16 (50\%) of 32 lesions were hypovascular.
{CONCLUSIONS:} At {CEUS} the depiction of tumoral margins of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is more accurate in low enhancement than in high enhancement. The pattern of enhancement of pancreatic adenocarcinoma influences the depiction of tumoral margins at {CEUS.}},

Routine diagnostic procedures included endoscopic ultrasound, {MRI}, or multislice helical {CT} of the upper gastrointestinal tract in all patients. Uptake of ({18)F-FLT} was evaluated semiquantitatively by calculation of mean and maximal standardized uptake values ({SUVs).} Results were correlated to the reference methods, which were histopathology (23/31) or cytology/clinical follow-up (8/31).
{RESULTS:} All 10 benign pancreatic lesions were negative on ({18)F-FLT} {PET} and showed only background activity (specificity, 100\%; 90\% confidence interval, 74\%-100\%). On visual interpretation, 15 of 21 malignant tumors presented as focal ({18)F-FLT} uptake higher than the surrounding background (sensitivity, 71.4\%; 90\% confidence interval, 52\%-89\%). ({18)F-FLT} {PET} missed 4 well-differentiated and 2 T1 cancers.

{METHODS:} A preliminary study (phase I) and a prospective (phase {II)} study were conducted. Phase I: subjects were 10 volunteers, 5 with cancer, 2 with endocrine tumor, 5 with chronic pancreatitis, 14 with intraductal papillary-mucinous neoplasm. To determine the characteristic {EG} images (diagnostic criteria for phase {II)}, B-mode images were compared with {EG} images and histopathologic findings. Phase {II:} 53 consecutive patients were enrolled. The visualization rate by {EG-US} in lesions visualized by B mode was assessed, and the correct diagnosis rate by B mode alone (B diagnosis) or in combination with {EG-US} was evaluated.
{RESULTS:} Phase I: normal parenchyma was a homogeneous color. In cancer, {EG-US} showed a markedly hard area with soft spots inside. Endocrine tumor was uniform and soft comparable to parenchyma. Chronic pancreatitis showed a mixture of various colors. Phase {II:} we identified 77.4\% (41/53) of the lesions and observed 60.0\% (15/25) of the cancers, 100\% (3/3) of the endocrine tumor, 92.0\% (23/25) of the cases of chronic pancreatitis cases on {EG-US.} The B-diagnosis rates ranged from about 70\% to 80\%.

Although 2-[({18)F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose} positron emission tomography ({FDG-PET)} has been demonstrated to be useful in the staging of many malignancies (e.g. esophageal cancer, recurrent colorectal cancer, lung cancer), it has not been found to significantly increase the accuracy of determining resectability preoperatively in pancreatic cancer, especially with regard to detection of small volume metastatic disease. There are a variety of pancreatic cancer-specific antigens which are being developed as a method for targeted molecular imaging; we provide preliminary data targeting the integrin alpha(v)beta(6) to demonstrate the potential feasibility of this approach.

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Forty patients who had undergone pancreatic {CT} angiography ({CTA)} on 16-{MDCT} scanner and had surgery were included. Contrast medium of 2 iodine concentrations (group A, 300 {mg/mL}, n = 20; group B, 370 {mg/mL}, n = 20) from the same vendor (Isovue; Bracco Diagnostics), with iodine dose of 550 to 600 mg/kg of body weight, was injected at a rate of 5 {mL/s.} Dual-phase 16-row {MDCT} was performed using 1.25- and 5-mm collimation for the arterial and portal phases, respectively. For the quantitative analysis, Hounsfield units values in the aorta, superior mesenteric artery, portal vein, and pancreas during arterial and venous phases were measured. Two readers subjectively rated the overall image enhancement, 3-dimensional image quality, and lesion and pancreatic duct conspicuity. Accuracy of lesion resectability was also established for each patient. The data were compared using Student t test for statistical analysis.
{RESULTS:} The quantitative analysis for the degree of enhancement (Hounsfield unit) of the aorta, superior mesenteric artery, and pancreas during the arterial phase demonstrated similar values in groups A (low-concentration {CM)} and B (high-concentration {CM)}, with no statistically significant difference with each other (P {\textgreater} 0.05). During the portal venous phase, we found superior enhancements in the superior mesenteric and portal veins in group A (P {\textless} 0.05). The qualitative assessments of the overall image enhancement and 3-dimensional image quality on a 5-point scale were 4.3 and 4.65, respectively (P {\textless} 0.05), in group A and 4.6 and 4.75, respectively, in group B, whereas on a 3-point scale, the pancreatic duct display and lesion conspicuity were 2.75 and 2.85, respectively, in group A and 2.9 and 2.9, respectively, in group B. The accuracy for lesion resectability was 95\% (19/20) in group A and 100\% (20/20) in group B (P {\textgreater} 0.05).
{CONCLUSION:} Both {CMs} demonstrated comparable performance for 16-row {MDCT} of the pancreas for presurgical planning. However, high-concentration {CM} (370 mg of iodine per milliliter) provides higher overall enhancement and superior-quality 3-dimensional images with a shorter injection duration.},

	abstract = {{RATIONALE} {AND} {OBJECTIVES:} The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare the maximum intensity projection ({MIP)} images generated at a multidetector computed tomography ({MDCT)} scanner console using advanced tools at a three-dimensional ({3D)} workstation for assessment of pancreatic tumor resectability.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Institutional review board approval and informed consent wavier were obtained for this retrospective study. The intraoperative findings were used as reference standard. Two radiologists assessed console {MIPs} that were created using computed tomographic ({CT)} data sets of 30 patients (17 men and 13 women; age range, 35-79 years; mean age, 58 years) operated for pancreatic tumors. Semi-automated {MIP} images were created on a separate {MDCT} console. Two blinded radiologist (R1, R2) and surgeons (S1, S2) evaluated the image data independently for vascular involvement and tumor resectability. The image quality and diagnostic confidence for {MIPs} were graded on a 5-point scale (1 = poor, 2 = suboptimal, 3 = intermediate, 4 = good; 5 = excellent) and comparison was made with {3D} workstation image scores.
{RESULTS:} The findings revealed greater than 90\% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for detecting involvement of peripancreatic vessels by pancreatic tumor with an excellent interobserver agreement (kappa = 0.87-1.00). The findings of console-generated {MIPs} were same as the findings of {3D} workstation images. The mean of image quality and diagnostic confidence grading for console {MIPs} by assessors were 4.4 and 4.2, respectively. The average time to generate simple {MIPs} at the console was 3.4 minutes (range, 2.3-4.4) compared to 26 minutes (range, 18-33) to create images at the {3D} workstation.
{CONCLUSION:} Semi-automated {MIPs} generated from an {MDCT} scanner console is an excellent alternative to {3D} workstation images for assessing resectability of pancreatic tumor based on vascular involvement. Console {MIPs} can be quickly generated during the time of scan and thus can improve {CT} workflow.},

{METHODS:} Eighty-two patients with potentially resectable {PN} underwent staging with {PET/CT} and {CT} of the chest and abdomen. Sensitivity of diagnosing pancreatic cancer by {PET/CT} avidity was evaluated. The sensitivity of detecting metastases was compared between {PET/CT}, standard {CT}, and the combination of {PET/CT} and {CT.} The impact of {PET/CT} on patient management was estimated by calculating the percentage of patients whose treatment plan was altered due to {PET/CT.}
{RESULTS:} The sensitivity and specificity of {PET/CT} in diagnosing pancreatic cancer were 89\% and 88\%, respectively. Sensitivity of detecting metastatic disease for {PET/CT} alone, standard {CT} alone, and the combination of {PET/CT} and {CT} were 61\%, 57\%, and 87\%, respectively.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Consequently, identification of clinically relevant biomarkers for the early detection of this cancer type is urgently needed. In recent years, proteomics profiling techniques combined with various data analysis methods have been successfully used to gain critical insights into processes and mechanisms underlying pathologic conditions, particularly as they relate to cancer. However, the high dimensionality of proteomics data combined with their relatively small sample sizes poses a significant challenge to current data mining methodology where many of the standard methods cannot be applied directly. Here, we propose a novel methodological framework using machine learning method, in which decision tree based classifier ensembles coupled with feature selection methods, is applied to proteomics data generated from premalignant pancreatic cancer.
{RESULTS:} This study explores the utility of three different feature selection schemas (Student t test, Wilcoxon rank sum test and genetic algorithm) to reduce the high dimensionality of a pancreatic cancer proteomic dataset. Using the top features selected from each method, we compared the prediction performances of a single decision tree algorithm C4.5 with six different decision-tree based classifier ensembles (Random forest, Stacked generalization, Bagging, Adaboost, Logitboost and Multiboost). We show that ensemble classifiers always outperform single decision tree classifier in having greater accuracies and smaller prediction errors when applied to a pancreatic cancer proteomics dataset.
{CONCLUSION:} In our cross validation framework, classifier ensembles generally have better classification accuracies compared to that of a single decision tree when applied to a pancreatic cancer proteomic dataset, thus suggesting its utility in future proteomics data analysis. Additionally, the use of feature selection method allows us to select biomarkers with potentially important roles in cancer development, therefore highlighting the validity of this method.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND/PURPOSE:} When a pancreatoduodenectomy is to be conducted, preoperative understanding of the vascular anatomy of the pancreatic head is important in order to reduce intraoperative bleeding. Using multislice computed tomography ({MS-CT)}, we investigated the depiction rate and branching of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery ({IPDA)} and dorsal pancreatic artery ({DPA)}, afferent arteries to the pancreatic head.
{METHODS:} In 109 patients (68 with pancreatic cancer, 21 with biliary tract cancer, 15 with intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas, and 5 others), images were taken, using 64-row {MS-CT}, in the early and late arterial phases.
{RESULTS:} The depiction rates were 98.2\% for the {IPDA} and 96.3\% for the {DPA.} Branching of the {IPDA} was categorized into three types: a type in which the {IPDA} formed a common vessel with the first jejunal branch (72.0\%), a type in which the {IPDA} branched directly from the superior mesenteric artery (18.7\%), and a type in which the anterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery ({AIPDA)} and posterior inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery ({PIPDA)} branched separately (9.3\%). {DPA} branching was categorized into five types, in which the {DPA} branched from the splenic artery (40.0\%), from the common hepatic artery (25.7\%), from the superior mesenteric artery (20.0\%), and from the celiac artery (8.6\%), and a type in which the {DPA} branching did not follow any of the above patterns (5.7\%).
{CONCLUSIONS:} {MS-CT} images of vascular architecture enable evaluation from any angle, which is not possible with conventional angiography, making {MS-CT} a useful diagnostic imaging technique for understanding the vascular anatomy of the pancreatic head prior to conducting pancreatoduodenectomy for diseases of the pancreatic head region.},

{METHODS:} Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study and waived the requirement for informed consent. Forty-two patients with surgically proven hilar or extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, who underwent preoperative imaging with triple-phasic multidetector-row computed tomography, were included in this study. Images obtained during each phase were reviewed by 2 independent observers who assessed the tumor conspicuity and the biliary extent of the tumor and vascular invasion by the tumor. For quantitative analysis, another radiologist measured the tumor attenuation, the normal liver parenchyma, the aorta, and the main portal vein on each phase image.
{RESULTS:} The degree of tumor conspicuity was higher in the pancreatic and hepatic phases than in the arterial phase (P {\textless} 0.01); however, there was no statistical difference in tumor conspicuity between the pancreatic and hepatic phases (P {\textgreater} 0.05). The mean tumor attenuation was greater in the hepatic phase at 114.2 +/- 24.6 Hounsfield units versus 72.9 +/- 18.3 Hounsfield units in the arterial phase (P {\textless} 0.001). The images obtained in the hepatic phases were significantly superior to those obtained in the arterial phase for predicting the tumor involvement into the secondary biliary confluence (P {\textless} 0.05).

Sensitivity (81-89\%), specificity (74-88\%), {PPV} (83-90\%) and {NPV} (77-82\%) achieved by {EUS}, {ERCP} and {US} were not significantly different. {PET} analysis revealed significantly higher maximum mean standardised uptake values ({SUV(max)} 6.5+/-4.6) in patients with pancreatic malignancy (benign lesions: {SUV(max)} 4.2+/-1.5; p{\textless}0.05). {PET-CT} revealed cervical lymphonodal metastasis from occult bronchogenic carcinoma and a tubular colon adenoma with intermediate dysplasia on polypectomy, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS:} ({18)F-FDG} {PET-CT} achieves a comparably high diagnostic impact evaluating small solid pancreatic lesions versus conventional reference imaging modalities. Additional clinical diagnoses are derived from concomitant whole-body {PET-CT} imaging.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} To evaluate the impact of a multidisciplinary clinic on the clinical care recommendations of patients with pancreatic cancer compared with the recommendations the patients received prior to review by the multidisciplinary tumor board.
{METHODS:} The records of 203 consecutive patients referred to the Johns Hopkins pancreatic multidisciplinary clinic were prospectively collected from November 2006 to October 2007. Cross-sectional imaging, pathology, and medical history were evaluated by a panel of medical/radiation oncologists, surgical oncologists, pathologists, diagnostic radiologists, and geneticists. Alterations in treatment recommendations between the outside institution and the multidisciplinary clinic were recorded and compared.
{RESULTS:} On presentation, the outside computed tomography ({CT)} report described locally advanced/unresectable disease (34.9\%), metastatic disease (17.7\%), and locally advanced disease with metastasis (1.1\%). On review of submitted imaging and imaging performed at Hopkins, 38 out of 203 (18.7\%) patients had a change in the status of their clinical stage. Review of the histological slides by dedicated pancreatic pathologists resulted in changes in the interpretation for 7 of 203 patients (3.4\%). Overall, 48 out of 203 (23.6\%) patients had a change in their recommended management based on clinical review of their case by the multidisciplinary tumor board. Enrollment into the National Familial Pancreas Tumor Registry increased from 52 out of 106 (49.2\%) patients in 2005 to 158 out of 203 (77.8\%) with initiation of the multidisciplinary clinic.
{CONCLUSION:} The single-day pancreatic multidisciplinary clinic provided a comprehensive and coordinated evaluation of patients that led to changes in therapeutic recommendations in close to one-quarter of patients.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} \& {AIMS:} Endoscopic ultrasound is a widely accepted imaging method for staging of ductal adenocarcinoma and the localization of neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas. We prospectively evaluated conventional color Doppler imaging and contrast-enhanced endoscopic Doppler ultrasound ({CE-EDUS)} as a new imaging technique for further characterization and differentiation of solid pancreatic tumors.
{METHODS:} From 300 patients with pancreatic lesions investigated using contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound we could finally include 93 patients with an undetermined, solitary, predominantly solid, lesion 40 mm or less, and a definite histologically proven diagnosis. After bolus injection of the contrast agent {SHU} {508A} 4 g (400 {mg/dL)} the vascular pattern of the lesion during the arterial phase was compared with the vascularity of the residual pancreatic parenchyma.
{RESULTS:} Color Doppler imaging did not reveal vascularity of the pancreatic parenchyma in any of the patients, and therefore tumor hypovascularity could not be determined in contrast to all {CE-EDUS-examined} patients revealing at least some degree of parenchymal vascularity. Fifty-seven of 62 patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas showed a hypovascularity of the tumor using {CE-EDUS.} All other pancreatic lesions revealed an isovascular or hypervascular pattern using contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound (20 neuroendocrine tumors, 10 serous microcystic adenomas, and 1 teratoma). Hypovascularity as a sign of malignancy in contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound obtained 92\% (82\%-97\%) sensitivity and 100\% specificity (89\%-100\%).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound is effective in differentiating small solid pancreatic tumors of different origin in most cases. Hypovascularity indicates malignancy of pancreatic tumors.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND/AIMS:} The prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer remains very poor. Although many studies have evaluated the prognostic factors of pancreatic cancer, their results are inconclusive because of different inclusion criteria, tumor stages, and treatment modalities. This large scale retrospective analysis was performed to assess whether active treatment of pancreatic cancer, even in its advanced stage, could improve patients' survival. In addition, we sought to identify factors associated with favorable prognosis of pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} Between 1994 and 2004, a total of 971 patients with pancreatic cancer were treated at Asan Medical Center. The patients were classified into three groups according to clinical stages: resectable ({RE}, n=226), locally advanced ({LA}, n=409), and far advanced ({FA}, n=336). Treatment response and prognostic factors for survival were analyzed in each group.
{RESULTS:} Compared to supportive care, active treatment significantly increased the median survival time in all groups ({RE:} 18.0 vs. 9.0 months; {LA:} 10.0 vs. 7.0 months; {FA:} 5.0 vs. 3.0 months). Multivariate analysis showed that prognostic factors for survival differed according to clinical stages. In the {RE} group, unfavorable prognostic factors were high {CA} 19-9, poor histologic differentiation, large tumor size, and regional lymph node involvement. In the {FA} group, however, poor outcomes were associated with old age, poor performance status, and hypoalbuminemia.
{CONCLUSIONS:} More active treatment of pancreatic cancer, even in advanced stage, can make a significant difference in terms of patient's survival. The prognosis of resectable pancreatic cancer is dependent on tumor-related factors, while the prognosis of patients with far advanced pancreatic cancer is dependent on patient-related factors.},

	abstract = {Serous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas have currently five recognized subtypes: serous microcystic adenoma, serous oligocystic ill-demarcated adenoma, solid serous adenoma, von Hippel-Lindau-associated cystic neoplasm, and serous cystadenocarcinoma. Although these neoplasms are histologically similar they may differ in location, gross appearance and biology. Solid serous adenoma of the pancreas is by far the rarest subtype with only nine cases published thus far. In this review, we will discuss clinical features, imaging characteristics and histopathological findings, considering in particular (1) difficulties in preoperative diagnosis; and (2) relevant immunohistochemical analysis. After analyzing the literature, including one case from our Department, we can conclude that there is enough evidence to support that solid serous adenomas of the pancreas is a solid variant of serous cystadenomas. To date no malignant transformation is reported so far and therefore, to our knowledge, all patients are alive and without recurrence. Incidence is generally around seventh decade of life with no gender preference. Preoperative diagnosis is difficult to establish but magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography may be useful. Given benign nature of this solid variant conservative surgery is recommended. It is definitively a rare entity but oncologic surgeons should be aware of this neoplasm in order to make a correct preoperative diagnosis that will ultimately result in more conservative surgeries.},

{METHODS:} Twenty-two patients with metastases to the pancreas were examined preoperatively by {MRI} (7/22) and/or multidetector {CT} (15/22). Pre- and post-contrast images were acquired and morphology, size, and contrast enhancement of the tumor analyzed. Subsequently, all patients underwent surgery, and the histopathologic findings were compared with the imaging results.
{RESULTS:} In 22 patients, a total of 29 metastases were found on {CT} and {MRI.} These metastases originated from renal cell carcinomas ({RCC;} 22/29), colorectal carcinoma (3/29), and other malignancies (4/29). The metastases differed not in size or location, but in their contrast enhancement characteristics. {RCC} metastases had either intense homogeneous enhancement (in small lesions) or rim enhancement (in large lesions). Outer regions of colorectal metastases showed no difference from normal pancreatic tissue, whereas the inner area showed hypo-enhancement due to central necrosis.
{CONCLUSION:} Imaging features of metastases from {RCC} point to their primary origin. While they can be distinguished from primary adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, differentiation from endocrine carcinoma might be difficult. Differentiation of colorectal carcinoma remains to be investigated on larger numbers of cases.},

{OBJECTIVE:} To determine the prevalence of pancreatic neoplasm in this patient group.
{DESIGN:} Retrospective analysis of a prospective database.
{SETTING:} Tertiary-care university hospital.
{PATIENTS:} Patients without obstructive jaundice at initial presentation, who underwent {EUS} and/or {EUS-guided} {FNA} ({EUS-FNA)} for an abnormal {CT} and/or {MRI} with an enlarged {HOP} (n = 67) or a {PD} with or without a dilated {CBD} (n = 43).

{INTERVENTIONS:} An {EUS} examination was performed by using a radial echoendoscopy followed by a linear echoendoscopy, if a focal pancreatic lesion was identified. Fine-needle aspirates were stained with Diff-Quik and Papanicolaou's methods, and were immediately assessed by an attending cytopathologist.

{METHODS:} Data were collected retrospectively from 388 patients (398 procedures) for whom a final diagnosis was available and who underwent ultrasound-guided pancreatic or liver metastases biopsy with a 21-gauge needle (core biopsy) or a 22-gauge needle (fine-needle aspiration biopsy: {FNAB).} The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of pancreatic and liver metastases biopsies were evaluated. Biopsy-related complications were collected and analyzed.
{RESULTS:} Data from 271 pancreatic and 112 liver metastases biopsy procedures were available. For pancreatic core biopsy and {FNAB}, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 93\%, 100\%, and 93\%, and 86\%, 100\%, and 86\%, respectively, all of which were comparable to those of liver metastases biopsy. The complication rate in pancreatic biopsy was 21.4\%, including a 4.4\% incidence of post-biopsy ephemeral fever. The complication rate in liver metastases biopsy was 38.7\%, including an 8.0\% incidence of ephemeral fever. Fever and infection occurred more frequently among patients who underwent liver metastases biopsy (4.4\% vs. 11\%: P = 0.038). In pancreatic biopsy cases, a prebiopsy high serum total bilirubin level was a statistically significant predictor of ephemeral fever.

{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} Forty-six consecutive patients (23 women, 23 men; median age 62.5 years) underwent {FDG-PET/CT.} Analysis of {PET}, {CT} and fused {PET/CT} images was performed by 2 readers. Patients were divided into 2 groups: diagnosis and staging of primary tumours (n=34) and restaging: screening for recurrent or progressive pancreatic cancer (n=12). Accuracy analysis was performed lesion-by-lesion and patient-by-patient. Results were correlated with histopathology or clinical follow-up.
{RESULTS:} Ninety-five foci were identified on {PET}, 140 lesions on {CT} and 119 on {PET/CT.} Thirty-four lesions were defined as 'definitely pathologic' and localised in pancreas, liver, lung or bone by all 3 techniques with equal certainty. In 11 patients malignancy was ruled out with the highest certainty by {PET/CT.} All 3 modalities made 2 false positive diagnoses of malignancy and missed metastases or vascular ingrowth in 7 patients. The accuracy rate of {PET/CT} (91.2\%) for diagnosis of primary pancreatic lesions is higher compared to {CT} (88.2\%) and {PET} alone (82.3\%). Also for locoregional staging {PET/CT} has a higher accuracy rate (85.3\%) compared to {CT} (83.8\%) and {PET} (79.4\%). When used for restaging, sensitivity (90.0\%) and accuracy rate (91.6\%) were highest for {PET} and {PET/CT.} {CT} had a lower sensitivity (80.0\%).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Topographical assignment of 'spots' with high {FDG} uptake is superior with {PET/CT} compared to {PET} alone. Fused {PET/CT} has a slightly higher sensitivity and accuracy rate for diagnosis and locoregional staging of primary pancreatic lesions compared to {CT} alone. {PET} and {PET/CT} perform equally well in screening for recurrent or progressive pancreatic cancer, with high accuracy.

{OBJECTIVE:} Determine the accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound in predicting the need for surgical exploration in patients with solid pancreatic masses deemed by computer tomography to be resectable without venous grafting (absence of distant metastatic disease or major vascular involvement).
{PATIENTS:} All patients between March 2000 and November 2003 with focal pancreatic mass lesions deemed to be surgically resectable by computer tomography. Forty-nine patients participated (29 males, 20 females; age range: 40-86 years).
{INTERVENTION:} Preoperative linear-array endoscopic ultrasound.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURE:} Surgical pathology compared to computer tomography and endoscopic ultrasound results.
{RESULTS:} Out of the 49 patients, 33 (67.3\%) had pancreatic neoplasms and 16 (32.7\%) had chronic pancreatitis. Endoscopic ultrasound correctly diagnosed all 16 patients with chronic pancreatitis. Endoscopic ultrasound correctly identified 18 (54.5\%) of those with neoplasms as having unresectable disease while 6 (18.2\%) patients were appropriately identified as resectable by endoscopic ultrasound. The remaining 9 patients (27.3\%) were deemed resectable by endoscopic ultrasound, but were unresectable at the time of surgery. None of the patients were falsely designated as unresectable by endoscopic ultrasound.
{CONCLUSION:} Endoscopic ultrasound is an important compliment to computed tomography in predicting resectability and in avoiding nontherapeutic laparotomy of solid pancreatic neoplasms. Moreover, endoscopic ultrasound classification did not discourage surgery of resectable pancreatic masses.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} The primary aim of this prospective pilot study was to determine if the administration of intravenous secretin prior to contrast-enhanced computed tomography ({CT)} improves pancreatic enhancement and pancreatic tumor conspicuity. The second aim was to determine the optimal timing for secretin administration prior to contrast-enhanced {CT.}
{METHODS:} Local ethics committee approval was obtained. 35 patients (18 men, 17 women; mean age, 67.6 years; age range; 25 to 86 years) with known or suspected pancreatic malignancy or an abdominal malignancy underwent a helical {CT} of the pancreas. The pancreas was first localised on an unenhanced scan using 10mm sections. Following 120 ml of intravenous 300 mg/ml of non ionic contrast medium ({CM)}, injected at a rate of 5 ml/s, images of the pancreas (3mm slice thickness) and liver (8mm slice thickness) were obtained at 40 and 70 seconds respectively. A second {CT} was obtained 1-5 days after the first one using the same {CT} and intravenous contrast medium injection parameters. However 100 {IU} of secretin was given as an intravenous bolus between 0 and 5 min prior to intravenous contrast medium administration. Each patient acted as their own control. The attenuation in Hounsfield Units ({HU)} was recorded on non-contrast, pancreatic phase and portal venous phases for both secretin and non-secretin {CTs}, in the pancreas and pancreatic tumors (where present). Tumor conspicuity was calculated (in the 19 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas) by subtracting pancreatic tumor attenuation from pancreatic attenuation. Statistical evaluation comparing pre and post secretin enhancement was performed using matched paired t-tests.
{RESULTS:} A significant increase in pancreatic enhancement was observed when secretin was injected at 2 to 3 min before contrast material injection (the increase in pancreatic density following secretin at 2 min was 31.5+/-10 {HU} (29.2\%) (p=.035); and at 3 min was 23.2+/-7.8 {HU} (22.7\%) (p=.041). Pancreatic tumor conspicuity in the pancreatic phase was most marked when secretin was injected between 2 to 4 min before contrast medium, with 4 min showing a statistically significant increase in tumor conspicuity, 48.2+/-14.2 {HU} (p=.04).
{CONCLUSION:} Imaging in the pancreatic phase 2 to 4 min after administration of intravenous secretin leads to greater enhancement of the pancreas with greater tumor conspicuity, than imaging without secretin.},

	abstract = {Inconclusive findings on abdominal computerized tomography ({CT)} scans such as "enlarged or prominent pancreas" are commonly reported; however, their clinical significance is not clearly understood. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} in a cohort of patients with indeterminate findings on {CT.} We undertook a retrospective, single-center study at a tertiary care university hospital. About 107 consecutive patients (56 men) underwent {EUS} evaluation for inconclusive {CT} findings. The main intervention was {EUS} with fine needle aspiration ({FNA)} The main outcome measurement was to describe lesions identified by {EUS} in this cohort of patients. About 22 patients (21\%) had pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 14 (13\%) had chronic pancreatitis, 28 (26\%) had benign lesions, and 35 patients (33\%) had a normal {EUS} exam. Pancreatic cancer was more likely to be found on {EUS} in patients with significant weight loss ({OR} 10.1; 95\% {CI:} 3.3-30.60), hyperbilirubinemia ({OR} 9; 95\% {CI:} 3-26.0), or common bile duct ({CBD)} dilatation ({OR} 3.2; 95\% {CI:} 1.25-8.5). The limitations of the study were that we were unable to control the uniformity of {CT} interpretation because the scans were reviewed by multiple radiologists. There were also limited follow-up data on patients who had benign lesions or normal {EUS.} In conclusion, {EUS} is an effective modality for evaluating pancreatic lesions in patients with inconclusive findings on abdominal {CT.} This assists in the prompt diagnosis and institution of appropriate treatment strategies for a variety of pancreatic diseases including cancer. In the setting of inconclusive {CT} findings, patients with hyperbilirubinemia, significant weight loss, or {CBD} dilatation should undergo {EUS} evaluation as they are at a higher risk of having underlying pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {Technical advances of magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)}, including ultrahigh-field magnetic resonance at 3.0 T, parallel imaging techniques, and multichannel receive coils of the abdomen, have promoted {MRI} of the pancreas. For adenocarcinoma, which is the most common malignant pancreatic tumor, helical {CT} has been most often used for detection and staging, but it has limitations in the detection of small cancers 2 cm in diameter or less (sensitivity, 63\%). Moreover, it is not very accurate in determining nonresectability, because small liver metastases, peritoneal carcinomatosis, and subtle signs of vascular infiltration may be missed. At ultrahigh field at 3.0 T, gadolinium-enhanced {MRI} using volume-interpolated 3-dimensional gradient-recalled echo pulse sequences with near-isotropic voxels are very useful for detection of subtle abnormalities. Mangafodipir-enhanced {MRI} reveals a very high tumor-pancreas contrast, which helps to diagnose small cancers. Contrast-enhanced {MRI} is a problem-solving tool in case of equivocal {CT:} it helps to differentiate between cancer and focal pancreatitis. Neuroendocrine carcinoma may present with a spectrum of appearances at {MRI}, but the primary tumor and liver metastases are hypervascular in approximately 70\%.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Over the last decades, the incidence of pancreatic cancer has increased. Prognosis remains poor despite rapid improvements in imaging technologies and therapeutic modalities. Curative treatment is dependant on early diagnosis.
{MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS:} One of the most promising techniques for early detection of pancreatic lesions seems to be endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS).} With or without fine needle aspiration ({FNA)}, it has been described as highly sensitive and accurate in staging. Superior to other imaging modalities in early studies, results in later publications declined. There are three fundamental different techniques of {EUS} available at present: radial scanning scopes, linear scanning scopes and radial or linear scanning probes, each with different pros and cons. Indications for {EUS} are persistent epigastric and/or back pain, acute onset of diabetes in the elderly, unclairified weight loss and suspect results in ultrasonography, especially in individuals over 45 years of age and in high-risk subpopulations.
{RESULTS:} In early studies, {EUS} was superior or at least equal to other imaging modalities regarding sensitivity, determining tumour size and extent, lymph node involvement and vascular infiltration. With rapid advances in technology, first of all, computed tomography ({CT)} and magnetic resonance imaging have reached better results. The highest accuracy in assessing extent of primary tumour, locoregional extension, vascular invasion, distant metastasis, tumour {TNM} stage and tumour resectability seems to have helical {CT}, whereas {EUS} has the highest accuracy in assessing tumour size and lymph node involvement. For assessment of tumour resectability, a combination of {CT} and {EUS} seems to be the procedure with the highest accuracy. Some new techniques promise improvement of the diagnostic yield of {EUS.} In differentiation to focal inflammation, contrast-enhanced {EUS} has shown to increase sensitivity and specificity for pancreatic cancer. Another major problem is the assessment of vascular invasion. {3D} reconstructions additional to conventional {EUS} seemed to improve the evaluation of vessel-tumour-relationships. Endoscopic ultrasound is not a foolproof method; there are several reasons for failure, and it shows a high interobserver variety even among experienced endosonographers. Nevertheless, {EUS} proved to have a high negative predictive value. Poor overall survival rates and some reports of high survival rates among small resected stage 1 ductal adenocarcinomas suggest a high benefit for screening and early detection of pancreatic neoplasia, and treatment of precursor lesions might prevent their progression to invasive cancer. Because of low incidence and the lack of accurate, inexpensive and non-invasive diagnostic tests for early disease, screening for pancreatic cancer and its precursor lesions in the entire population is not reasonable. But a {EUS-} and {CT-based} screening among high-risk individuals discovered pancreatic neoplasms in eight of 78 patients, in contrast to no pancreatic neoplasia among 149 control subjects.
{CONCLUSION:} Screening for pancreatic cancer and its precursor lesions in the general population is not feasible, but high-risk subpopulations seem to be suitable targets for screening programs. {EUS} is an essential tool for diagnosis and assessment of extension and resectability of pancreatic tumours.},

Especially, respiratory-triggered three-dimensional {MR} cholangiopancreatography ({3D-MRCP)} has been developed to provide images with high spatial resolution of the biliary tract and pancreatic duct. These {3D} data can be employed in {MR} virtual endoscopy ({MRVE)} with volume rendering to visualize the lumina of the gallbladder, bile duct, and pancreatic duct. To observe the changes in the lumina with threshold settings on a workstation, we made an original phantom with tubes 2, 3, and 6 mm in internal diameter. We examined the changes in luminal diameter using several threshold settings by comparing the actual internal diameters to determine an appropriate threshold setting, which we then applied in 50 clinical cases, including pancreatic tumors, hepatic tumors, and biliary tract stones. We obtained {MRVE} images of the gallbladder, bile duct, and pancreatic duct to assess the clinical usefulness of this method. In the phantom study, a value identical to the actual luminal diameter could be obtained with a threshold of less than 20\%. In all clinical cases, we obtained {MRVE} images of the gallbladder, bile duct, and pancreatic duct using the threshold we had determined appropriate and scored the diagnostic usefulness in each region. The {MRVE} images of the biliary tract provided much supplementary information, including the presence of stones and of duct invasion by the malignancy as wells as visualization of the post-stenotic portion. {MRVE} images of the gall bladder did not significantly improve diagnosis (P=0.311), but those of the bile and pancreatic ducts did (P{\textless}0.05). In addition, {MRVE} may aid navigation during cholangioscopy. Thus, {MRVE} is a clinically useful technique for examining lesions of the biliary tract and pancreas.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Tumor infiltration of the intima of the portal vein ({PV)} and superior mesenteric vein ({SMV)} by pancreatic adenocarcinoma is classically considered a criterion for unsuitability for resection and poor prognosis. This study was performed to evaluate modern color duplex imaging ({CDI)} for the assessment of {PV/SMV} infiltration by pancreatic adenocarcinomas.
{METHOD:} From 1994 to 2005, Whipple's procedure or pylorus-preserving pancreato-duodenectomy ({PPPD)} was performed in 303 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma; 35 of these underwent partial {PV/SMV} resection. Applying a previously reported {CDI} score, we evaluated the integrity of the echogenic border layer between the vein and tumor (mural demarcation) and maximum blood flow velocity (V (max)) in the {PV} segment in contact with the tumor. The results were compared to the final histological findings in the resected venous walls.
{RESULTS:} {CDI} findings correlated well with the histological invasion grades. By measuring V (max )and evaluating mural demarcation, we observed a sensitivity of 66.7\% and 100\% and a specificity of 98.3\% and 93.9\%, respectively, in predicting full thickness vein invasion, including the intima. V (max) above 80 cm/s and lack of mural demarcation were predictors of {PV/SMV} invasion. The postoperative survival rates depended on the depth of tumor infiltration into the {PV/SMV.}
{CONCLUSIONS:} Modern {CDI} is a reliable and valid technique for evaluation of morphological and hemodynamic parameters in the portal vein segment adjacent to pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Maximal blood-flow velocity in the portal segment in contact with the tumor and absence of the echogenic vessel-parenchymal sonographic interface are parameters predictive of tumor infiltration of the portal intima.},

Only 16 of the 74 patients (21.6\%) with small pancreatic cancers had T1 tumors. According to the International Union Against Cancer ({UICC)} staging, only 11 patients (14.9\%) were stage {IA:} their 5-yr survival rate was 23.3\% and their median survival was 30.0 months. Among these 11 patients, 3 had tumors {\textless}1cm; their median survival time was 30.0 months and their 5-yr survival rate was 50.0\%. These findings may indicate that 'small' pancreatic cancer is not equivalent to 'early' pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} {EUS} is limited by variability in the examiner's subjective interpretation of B-scan images to differentiate among normal, inflammatory, and malignant tissue. By using information otherwise discarded by conventional {EUS} systems, quantitative spectral analysis of the raw radiofrequency ({RF)} signals underlying {EUS} images enables tissue to be characterized more objectively.
{OBJECTIVE:} Our purpose was to determine the feasibility of using spectral analysis of {EUS} data for characterization of pancreatic tissue and lymph nodes.
{DESIGN} {AND} {SETTING:} A pilot study of eligible patients was conducted to analyze the {RF} data obtained during {EUS} by using spectral parameters.
{PATIENTS:} Twenty-one subjects who underwent {EUS} of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and surrounding intra-abdominal and mediastinal lymph nodes.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} Linear regression parameters of calibrated power spectra of the {RF} signals were tested to differentiate normal pancreas from chronic pancreatitis and from pancreatic cancer as well as benign from malignant-appearing lymph nodes.
{RESULTS:} The mean intercept, slope, and midband fit of the spectra differed significantly among normal pancreas, adenocarcinoma, and chronic pancreatitis when all were compared with each other (P {\textless} .01). On direct comparison, mean midband fit for adenocarcinoma differed significantly from that for chronic pancreatitis (P {\textless} .05). For lymph nodes, mean midband fit and intercept differed significantly between benign- and malignant-appearing lymph nodes (P {\textless} .01 and P {\textless} .05, respectively).
{LIMITATIONS:} Small sample population and spatial averaging inherent to this technique.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Mean spectral parameters in {EUS} imaging can provide a noninvasive method to discriminate normal from diseased pancreas and lymph nodes.},

Based on the two anlagens, the ventral or dorsal pancreas, we assessed the lymphatic spread pattern in 58 primary adenocarcinoma of head of the pancreas. Detection of lymph node metastasis was based on microscopic detection of carcinoma in consecutive serial sections of resected specimens including lymph nodes. When the tumor was confined to the ventral pancreas domain (n=20), the lymph node metastases were limited to areas along the superior mesenteric artery ({SMA)} besides peripancreatic lymph nodes. When the tumor was in the dorsal pancreas domain (n=6), the lymph node metastases were limited to areas along the common hepatic artery ({CHA)} and the hepatoduodenal ligament besides peripancreatic lymph nodes. When the tumor was extended into both domains (n=32), the lymph node metastases were distributed widely in areas along the {SMA}, {CHA} and the hepatoduodenal ligament besides peripancreatic lymph nodes.

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Institutional review board with waiver of informed consent was obtained for this {HIPAA} compliant study. A total of 33 patients (16 female, 17 male, mean age = 63.5 +/- 12.8, ranging from 41 to 80 years) with histopathologically-proven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma who underwent {MR} examination between August 2000 and February 2005 were retrospectively evaluated. Clinical data and histopathological tumoral grade were obtained from clinical charts; nine of 33 patients were excluded of the histopathological evaluation since their diagnosis was performed by fine needle aspiration biopsy and it was not possible to obtain the histopathological grade. Two radiologists reviewed all cases independently to identify whether cancers were poorly-marginated or focally-defined. Agreement between radiologists was assessed using the kappa coefficient. The overall correlation between imaging findings, clinical features, and histopathological grade was assessed with contingency tables using the Fisher's exact test.
{RESULTS:} Of the 33 patients, nine (27.2\%) were classified as poorly-marginated and 24 (72.8\%) as focally-defined. Agreement between the two reviewers was excellent (k = 0.92, 95\% confidence interval ({CI)} = 0.78-1.0). Poorly-marginated cancers exhibited well- to moderately-differentiated histopathology in 71.4\% of cases, while focally-defined cancers had well- to moderately-differentiated histopathology in 17.6\% of cases, P = 0.02.

{METHODS:} Patients with pancreatic head adenocarcinoma undergoing surgery with intent to resect during the last 5 years were identified. {EUS} and {CT} data on vascular involvement were collected. Preoperative imaging was compared to intraoperative findings and final pathology. Contingency table analysis using Fisher's exact test identified imaging features of {EUS} and {CT} associated with unresectability and positive margins.
{RESULTS:} Seventy-six patients met study criteria. Forty-seven (62\%) underwent potentially curative {PD.} The R0 resection rate was 70\%. There were 16 unresectable patients because of locally advanced disease. Venous involvement{\textgreater}180 degrees and arterial involvement{\textgreater}90 degrees by {CT} had 100\% positive predictive value for failure to achieve R0 resection (p{\textless}.01). If patients with prestudy biliary stents were excluded, {EUS} venous abutment or invasion also predicted R0 failure (p=.02). Combined but not individual {EUS} and {CT} findings were predictive of need for vein resection.

When {CT} findings and surgical reports were discordant, radiologists experienced in pancreatic imaging retrospectively reviewed images for lesion resectability; four-, eight-, 16-, and 64-row {CT} scanners were used in 54, 19, 25, and 16 patients, respectively. Collimation of 1.25 mm was used for four- and eight-row {CT} and 0.5 or 0.625 mm for 16- and 64-row {CT.} Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value ({PPV)}, and negative predictive value ({NPV)} for resectability were calculated for initial clinical interpretation and blinded retrospective review.
{RESULTS:} Eighty-eight patients had resectable lesions according to {CT} angiographic criteria (group A: 46 women, 42 men; mean age, 67 years; age range, 39-85 years): resection was aborted in 10 patients (11\%). Twenty-six patients underwent surgery despite lesion unresectability assessed according to {CT} angiographic criteria (group B: 16 women, 10 men; mean age, 62 years; age range, 33-83 years); all lesions were confirmed as unresectable. The initial clinical interpretation of {CT} angiographic scans in all 114 patients had 100\% sensitivity in the detection of resectability, 72\% specificity, 89\% {PPV}, and 100\% {NPV.} These parameters did not appear to vary among different types of scanner. With the blinded retrospective evaluation by experienced readers, specificity increased to 94\% and {PPV} to 98\%, with no difference in sensitivity and {NPV.}
{CONCLUSION:} Multidetector {CT} angiography is an effective preoperative tool that reduces the number of aborted pancreatic resections; there is no evidence from this retrospective study suggesting varying results from the various generations of multidetector {CT} scanners used.},

Forty-eight patients deemed to have resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma after assessment using biphasic {MDCT} with {MPRs} underwent surgery for potential tumor resection. Imaging findings were retrospectively evaluated for tumor resectability and correlated with surgical and pathological results. Curative resection was successful in 44 of 48 patients. The positive predictive value for tumor resectability made up 91\% with four false-negative results. The reasons for unresectability were venous involvement (1), small liver metastases (2) and peritoneal involvement associated with small metastases to lymph nodes (1). {MDCT} yielded a negative predictive value of 99\% (286 of 288 vessels) for detection of vascular invasion. Our results indicate the tendency towards improved prediction of resectability using {MDCT} compared to single-detector {CT.}},

Approximately 50\% of 1st-degree relatives ({FDRs)} have endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} findings of chronic pancreatitis. We modeled the natural history of these patients to compare 4 management strategies.
{METHODS:} We performed a systematic review, and created a Markov model for 45-year-old male {FDRs}, with findings of chronic pancreatitis on screening {EUS.} We compared 4 strategies: doing nothing, prophylactic total pancreatectomy ({PTP)}, annual surveillance by {EUS}, and annual surveillance with {EUS} and fine needle aspiration ({EUS/FNA).} Outcomes incorporated mortality, quality of life, procedural complications, and costs.
{RESULTS:} In the Do Nothing strategy, the lifetime risk of cancer was 20\%. Doing nothing provided the greatest remaining years of life, the lowest cost, and the greatest remaining quality-adjusted life years ({QALYs).} {PTP} provided the fewest remaining years of life, and the fewest remaining {QALYs.} Screening with {EUS} provided nearly identical results to {PTP}, and screening with {EUS/FNA} provided intermediate results between {PTP} and doing nothing. {PTP} provided the longest life expectancy if the lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer was at least 46\%, and provided the most {QALYs} if the risk was at least 68\%.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {FDRs} from familial pancreatic cancer kindreds, who have {EUS} findings of chronic pancreatitis, have increased risk for cancer, but their precise risk is unknown. Without the ability to further quantify that risk, the most effective strategy is to do nothing.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} This study was approved by the institutional review board, and patients gave informed consent. Seventy-eight patients suspected of having pancreatic tumor were randomly assigned to one of two protocols (39 patients in each protocol). In protocol 1, a fixed contrast material dose (120 {mL} of iohexol 300) was delivered at an injection rate of 4.0 {mL/sec;} in protocol 2, a dose tailored to the patient's body weight (2.0 {mL/kg)} was injected over the course of 30 seconds. Scans were started 25, 45 (pancreatic parenchymal phase [{PPP])}, and 70 (portal venous phase [{PVP])} seconds after the initiation of contrast material injection. Pancreatic enhancement during the {PPP} and hepatic enhancement during the {PVP} were compared by using the Student t test in patients whose body weight was less than 60 kg (group A) or 60 kg or greater (group B). A radiologist who was blinded to the injection protocol used measured the {CT} number of each organ.
{RESULTS:} With protocol 1, mean pancreatic enhancement during the {PPP} was 94.1 {HU} in group A and 76.1 {HU} in group B; the difference was statistically significant (P = .02). With protocol 2, mean pancreatic enhancement was 89.5 {HU} in group A and 84.7 {HU} in group B; there was no significant difference (P = .45). Mean hepatic enhancement with protocol 1 during the {PVP} was 59.6 {HU} in group A and 48.5 {HU} in group B (P {\textless} .01); with protocol 2, it was 55.4 {HU} in group A and 58.3 {HU} in group B. The difference was not statistically significant (P = .34).
{CONCLUSION:} The dose protocol tailored to the patient's body weight yielded satisfactory pancreatic and hepatic enhancement irrespective of patient weight.},

{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} We studied a consecutive series of patients who were undergoing preoperative {EUS} for diagnosis and staging of suspected pancreatic cancer, some of whom had biliary stents in situ and some of whom did not. The main end point was the uni- and multivariate association of biliary stenting with T and N mis-staging by {EUS.} The surgical T and N stages were used as gold standards.
{RESULTS:} A total of 65 patients were identified (19 with biliary stents in situ and 46 without). Surgical stage T4 was found more frequently in patients with stents (53\% vs. 22\%, P = 0.014). The T stage by {EUS} was correct in 85\% of the patients without biliary stents and in 47\% of the patients with stents. The frequency of mis-staging by {EUS} was significant only among patients with a biliary stent. The distribution by {EUS} N stage did not differ significantly from the surgical N-stage distribution in the two groups of patients. According to the multivariate analysis, patients with stents were 6.55 times more likely to be incorrectly T staged (95\% confidence interval [{CI]} 1.69-25.49) and 3.71 times more likely to be incorrectly N staged (95\% {CI} 1.11-12.45) than patients without stents.

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis. Improving survival will require diagnosis of early pancreatic cancer, which can be defined based on resectability, size, or curability. Pancreatic cancer progresses from noninvasive precursor lesions to invasive cancer over a variable time period. Retrospective review of computed tomography ({CT)} scans performed prior to diagnosis suggests that pancreatic cancer resectability may be significantly improved if detected as few as 6 months before clinical diagnosis. Since pancreatic cancer is relatively uncommon, to allow cost-effective screening the populations will have to be enriched for the disease using two "sieves." The first sieve would identify a population of subjects at higher than average risk of pancreatic cancer and the second sieve could be a characteristic phenotype among the members of the high-risk group, an abnormality seen on noninvasive imaging or a serologic marker of early pancreatic cancer. So far two high-risk groups have been targets of screening for pancreatic cancer: hereditary pancreatic cancer kindreds and new-onset diabetes. There is no serologic marker of early pancreatic cancer. Confirmation of diagnosis usually requires invasive procedures such as endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS).} Although much work still needs to be done, the developments in the field provide us with hope that screening for early pancreatic cancer could become a reality in the not-so-distant future.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Twenty-five patients, mean age 73 years, with proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma were imaged at 1.5 T using in- and opposed-phase, gradient-echo ({GRE)}, T1-weighted sequences, T2 weighting using either a short tau inversion recovery ({STIR)} or frequency selective, fat-suppressed turbo spin echo ({TSE)} sequence, and with a three-dimensional ({3D)}, fat-suppressed, {GRE} T1 sequence before, during the arterial, venous, and equilibrium phases after Gadolinium administration. Fourteen of the 25 patients underwent {CECT.} Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} examinations were evaluated by two observers in consensus for size, signal characteristics, and enhancement patterns, and the results were compared with {CECT.}
{RESULTS:} The mean size of pancreatic adenocarcinomas was 32 mm. On unenhanced T1-weighted images, 12 of 25 lesions (48\%) were hypointense, 13 (52\%) were isointense. On {STIR/T2}, 11 of 25 (44\%) pancreatic adenocarcinomas were hyperintense, 14 (56\%) were isointense. All 25 (100\%) adenocarcinomas were hypointense during the arterial phase. Twenty (80\%) and 17 (68\%) remained hypointense in the venous phase and equilibrium phases, respectively. In seven of 14 (50\%) cases, the pancreatic mass was iso-attenuating to the pancreatic parenchyma during both the pancreatic and venous phases of {CECT.}

{OBJECTIVES:} To determine the cytologic diagnostic rate of malignancy in {EUS-FNA} of solid pancreatic masses and to determine if variability exists among endoscopists and centers.
{DESIGN:} Multicenter retrospective study.
{PATIENTS:} {EUS} centers provided cytology reports for all {EUS-FNAs} of solid, noncystic, {\textgreater}or=10-mm-diameter, solid pancreatic masses during a 1-year period.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENT:} Cytology diagnostic of pancreatic malignancy.
{RESULTS:} A total of 1075 patients underwent {EUS-FNA} at 21 centers (81\% academic) with 41 endoscopists. The median number of {EUS-FNA} of solid pancreatic masses performed during the year per center was 46 (range, 4-177) and per endoscopist was 19 (range, 1-97). The mean mass dimensions were 32 x 27 mm, with 73\% located in the head. The mean number of passes was 3.5. Of the centers, 90\% used immediate cytologic evaluation. The overall diagnostic rate of malignancy was 71\%, 95\% confidence interval 0.69\%-0.74\%, with 5\% suspicious for malignancy, 6\% atypical cells, and 18\% negative for malignancy.

{METHODS:} The complete systematic review was made up of electronic files from the gastroenterology, oncology, and pathology departments of patients presenting with suspected {PCA.} Results were compared with those obtained in 1997-2001.
{RESULTS:} From 2001 to 2004, 72 patients had {PCA.} Seven tumor types were identified. Forty-seven percent (34/72) of patients with suspected {PCA} were preoperatively staged by {EUS;} 24\% (17/72) of all patients underwent surgery. Comparatively, from 1997 to 2001, only 32\% (20/62) of patients were evaluated by {EUS} (P = 0.056) and 45\% (28/62) of all patients underwent surgery (P {\textless} 0.01).

Six patients showed multiple wedge-shaped enhancements, which were initially diagnosed as multiple arterioportal shunts ({AP} shunts). However, metastatic tumors appeared within the area of wedge-shaped enhancement and increased in size on follow-up {CT} and/or {MR} images. After all, 43 of 87 patients (49\%) had {AP} shunt like contrast enhancement adjacent to liver metastases. Liver metastases from pancreatic carcinomas frequently show transient wedge-shaped enhancement, and should not be misdiagnosed as nontumorous arterioportal shunts.},

These limitations most significantly impact patients with autoimmune and nonspecific pancreatitis, but also cystic pancreatic tumors, vascular tumors, and less so ductal carcinoma. The {EUS} trucut biopsy ({TCB)} needle design overcomes many of the shortcomings of {EUS} {FNA} by acquiring larger tissue samples to allow histologic examination. However, these techniques should be considered complimentary as technical or interpretive failure with one device often indicates a need for biopsy with the alternate method. The suggested role of {EUS} {TCB} in pancreatic disease is based on limited data and personal experience. As such, further study is needed to determine if this experience is widely applicable. Issues of safety, accuracy, and cost must also be clarified and considered before establishing the role of {EUS} {TCB} relative to {EUS} {FNA.}},

We report on our experience with 15 redo procedures among a series of 350 consecutive pancreatic operations.
{PATIENT} {AND} {METHODS:} From January 1, 2004 to May 31, 2006 a total of 350 patients underwent pancreatic surgery in our department. There were 15 patients identified who had pancreatic redo surgery for benign (14) or malignant (1) disease. Perioperative parameters and outcome of 15 patients undergoing redo surgery after pancreatic resections were evaluated.
{RESULTS:} Operative procedures included revision and redo of the pancreaticojejunostomy after resection of the pancreatic margin (6), completion pancreatectomy (3), conversion from duodenum-preserving pancreatic head resection to pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (3), classic pancreaticoduodenectomy after nonresective pancreatic surgery (1), redo of left-sided pancreatectomy (1), and classic pancreaticoduodenectomy after left-sided pancreatectomy (1). Histology revealed chronic pancreatitis in 14 and a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in 1 patient. Median operative time was 335 min (235-615 min) and median intraoperative blood loss was 600 ml (300-2,800 ml). Median postoperative {ICU} stay was 20 h (4-113 h) and median postoperative hospital stay was 15 days (7-30 days). There was no perioperative mortality and morbidity was 33\%.
{CONCLUSION:} Pancreatic redo surgery can be performed with low morbidity and mortality. Redo surgery has a defined spectrum of indications, but to achieve good results surgery may be performed at high-volume centers.},

Two criteria were established for the assessment of the {PLX-II} running between the superior mesenteric artery ({SMA)} and the medial margin of the uncinate process: criterion A: assessment of the area around the {SMA} and inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery; criterion B: assessment of the jejunal trunk.

The aim of the study was to assess the usefulness of {MRI} and {MRCP} in the diagnosis of patients suspected of pancreatic carcinoma and to define the role of these methods in the evaluation of resectability of pancreatic cancer in comparison with surgical findings.
{MATERIAL/METHODS:} Forty-seven patients (32 men and 15 women) aged 46-81 had undergone {MRI} and {MRCP} examination of the upper abdomen on a 1.5 T system with a standard flexible surface coil. The results of those tests were compared with surgical and histopathological findings. The capacity of {MR} and {MRCP} to detect pathological mass, assess the nature of the disease process, and accurately assess the resectability of the malignant lesion were evaluated. In the statistical analysis the chi-squared and Fisher's precise tests were performed.
{RESULTS:} Statistical analysis showed 87\% sensitivity, 97\% specificity, and 95\% accuracy of {MRI} and {MRCP} in the evaluation of the nature of tumors within the pancreas and 100\% sensitivity, 90\% specificity, and 93\% accuracy in determining the resectability of the lesion. The positive predictive value came to 83\%, while the negative predictive value was 100\%. The kappa compatibility index in comparison with surgical findings was 0.85714.

{METHODS:} Patients with dilation of the main pancreatic duct on {CT} at Emory University Hospital in 2002 were identified by computer search. Clinical course and ultimate diagnosis were obtained in all the identified patients by abstraction of their computer database records.
{RESULTS:} Seventy-seven patients were identified in this study. Chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer were the most common causes of the main pancreatic duct dilation on {CT.} Although the majority of patients with isolated dilation of the main pancreatic duct (single duct dilation) had chronic pancreatitis, one-third of patients with single duct dilation but without chronic pancreatitis had pancreatic malignancies, whereas most of patients with concomitant biliary duct dilation (double duct dilation) had pancreatic cancer.
{CONCLUSION:} Patients with pancreatic double duct dilation need extensive work up and careful follow-up since a majority of these patients are ultimately diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Patients with single duct dilation, especially such patients without any evidence of chronic pancreatitis, also need careful follow-up since the possibility of pancreatic malignancy, including adenocarcinoma and intraductal papillary mucinous tumors, is still high.},

	abstract = {{NAD(P)H:quinone} oxidoreductase 1 ({NQO1)} is currently an emerging target in pancreatic cancer. In this report, we describe a series of indolequinones, based on 5-methoxy-1,2-dimethyl-3-[(4-nitrophenoxy)methyl]indole-4,7-dione ({ES936)}, and evaluate {NQO1} inhibition and growth inhibitory activity in the human pancreatic {MIA} {PaCa-2} tumor cell line. The indolequinones with 4-nitrophenoxy, 4-pyridinyloxy, and acetoxy substituents at the (indol-3-yl)methyl position were {NADH-dependent} inhibitors of recombinant human {NQO1}, indicative of mechanism-based inhibition. However, those with hydroxy and phenoxy substituents were poor inhibitors of {NQO1} enzyme activity, due to attenuated elimination of the leaving group. The ability of this series of indolequinones to inhibit recombinant human {NQO1} correlated with {NQO1} inhibition in {MIA} {PaCa-2} cells. The examination of indolequinone interactions in complex with {NQO1} from computational-based molecular docking simulations supported the observed biochemical data with respect to {NQO1} inhibition. The design of both {NQO1-inhibitory} and noninhibitory indolequinone analogues allowed us to test the hypothesis that {NQO1} inhibition was required for growth inhibitory activity in {MIA} {PaCa-2} cells. {ES936} and its 6-methoxy analogue were potent inhibitors of {NQO1} activity and cell proliferation; however, the 4-pyridinyloxy and acetoxy compounds were also potent inhibitors of {NQO1} activity but relatively poor inhibitors of cell proliferation. In addition, the phenoxy compounds, which were not inhibitors of {NQO1} enzymatic activity, demonstrated potent growth inhibition. These data demonstrate that {NQO1} inhibitory activity can be dissociated from growth inhibitory activity and suggest additional or alternative targets to {NQO1} that are responsible for the growth inhibitory activity of this series of indolequinones in human pancreatic cancer.},

We, therefore, analyzed the correlation between endosonographic findings and pancreatic carcinoma in a population with a high prevalence of chronic pancreatitis.
{METHODS:} 171 endosonographic examinations were retrospectively evaluated using 22 dichotomous criteria. Final diagnosis was defined by the results of pancreas resection or by clinical follow-up (median: 41 months). A sum score was established after multivariate analysis.
{RESULTS:} Final diagnosis was carcinoma, chronic pancreatitis, neuroendocrine tumor and normal pancreas in 67, 65, 9, and 38 subjects (prevalence 39 \%, 38 \%, 5 \%, 22 \% respectively) After multivariate analysis, carcinoma was significantly correlated with six endosonographic criteria and age, which resulted in the following score (yes = 1, no = 0): (dilated pancreatic duct) + (vascular infiltration) + (suspicious lymph nodes) + (tumor edge with pseudopodia-like extensions) + (age {\textgreater} 50 years) - (increased pancreas parenchyma echogenicity) - (tumor diameter {\textless} 10 mm) + 3.

{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} Interobserver agreement at baseline (training set) and after a consensus process (test set).
{RESULTS:} For the training set, interobserver agreement was good (kappa{\textgreater}or=0.4) for the presence of cysts and was fair to poor for all other rated {EUS} features and diagnosis of normal. There was no overall improvement in the test set. In both the training and test sets, agreement was worse for clips from {FPC} kindreds (kappa{\textgreater}or=0.4 for cysts and {\textless}0.4 for all other features) than for controls (kappa{\textgreater}or=0.4 for normal, cysts, masses, echogenic strands, and lobularity).
{LIMITATIONS:} Video clips were not of identical image quality and duration as a clinical {EUS} examination.
{CONCLUSIONS:} There was fair to poor interobserver agreement for the interpretation of pancreatic {EUS} video clips from members of {FPC} kindreds. Agreement was not improved by a consensus process.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies. An estimated 32,300 patients will die of pancreatic cancer in year 2006. It is the tenth most common malignancy in the United States. Despite recent advances in pathology, molecular basis and treatment, the overall survival rate remains 4\% for all stages and races. Palliative care represents an important aspect of care in patient with pancreatic malignancy. Identifying and treating disease related symptomology are priorities. As a physician taking care of these patients it is essential to know these symptoms and treatment modalities. This review discusses symptom management and supportive care strategies. Common problems include pain, intestinal obstruction, biliary obstruction, pancreatic insufficiency, anorexia-cachexia and depression. Success is needed in managing these symptoms to palliate patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is a model illness to learn the palliative and supportive management in cancer patient. It is important for oncologists to recognize the importance of control measures and supportive measures that can minimize the symptoms of advanced disease and side effects of cancer treatment.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} The aim of our study was to compare the accuracy of computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} in pre-operative staging of pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} Comparative retrospective study of 86 patients with pancreatic cancer. {CT} was done in 55 patients, 41 patients were examined by {EUS.} Each patient underwent surgery and had proven pancreatic cancer by histology. {CT} and {EUS} results were correlated to per-operative and histological findings. The main attention was paid to the description of peri-pancreatic lymphadenopathy, para-aortic lymphadenopathy, peri-coeliac lymphadenopathy and tumor relationship to superior mesenteric vein, superior mesenteric artery, portal vein, inferior caval vein and common hepatic artery. A description rate was defined as number of pre-operative findings where the structures and relationships mentioned above were described.
{RESULTS:} The description rates of peri-pancreatic lymph nodes were 11 (20\%) at {CT} and 36 (88.0\%) at {EUS.} Para-aortic lymphadenopathy was described in 9 (16.0\%) cases at {CT} and none at {EUS.} Peri-coeliac lymphadenopathy was mentioned only one time (2.0\%) at {CT} contrary to 12 (29.0\%) at {EUS.} Relationship of the tumor to the mesenteric vessels was well depicted in nine (16.0\%) at {CT} versus nine (22.0\%) at {EUS.} Portal vein relationship was well described in two (4.0\%) at {CT} and seven (17\%) cases at {EUS.} This description rate in vena cava inferior was one (2\%) at {CT} and three (7.0\%) at {EUS}, in hepatic artery it was one (2\%) at {CT} and six (15\%) at {EUS.} In the group of {CT}, resectability or non-resectability were well predicted in 33 (60\%) patients and wrong predicted in 22 (40\%) patients. In the group of {EUS}, resectability or non-resectability were well predicted in 34 (83\%) patients and wrong predicted in 7 (17\%) patients.
{CONCLUSION:} According to our study, {EUS} is more accurate in prediction of local {PC} resectability than {CT.}},

{METHODS:} In a retrospective analysis, 140 consecutive patients with carcinoma of the pancreatic head were studied. All were imaged using a standardized multidetector {CT} ({MDCT)} protocol. Patients with disease that was clearly inoperable were excluded. The remaining patients had their {CT} studies double-reported using a standard method. Images were scored for vascular involvement, tumor size, nodal disease, pancreatic duct diameter, and size of the gastrocolic trunk. Preoperative staging was compared with findings at surgery.
{RESULTS:} One hundred forty patients presented with pancreatic head tumors. One hundred were not suitable for surgery. Forty patients were considered for curative surgery. For assessing preoperative operability, {MDCT} has an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 72.7, 81.8, 68.2, 56, and 88.2\%, respectively.

{METHODS:} The study included 43 patients with pancreatic cancer who were evaluated from September 2002 to December 2003. These patients underwent preoperative evaluation by {angiography/CTHA/CTAP/CECT} (7-mm thickness) and by {MDCT} (1.25-mm thickness).
{RESULTS:} The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of liver metastasis diagnosis were all superior using {MDCT} relative to {CTHA/CTAP.} The diagnostic accuracy of liver metastasis for patients with tumors less than 10 mm in diameter was particularly superior with {MDCT} relative to {CTHA/CTAP.} The surgical and pathological findings of vascular involvement were more accurately diagnosed by {MDCT} than by {CTHA/CTAP/angiography/CECT.} Although {MDCT} findings were generally similar to surgical findings of vascular involvement, {MDCT} overestimated the incidence of pathological vascular involvement.

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is the most deadly of all gastrointestinal malignancies and has a very poor prognosis. Unfortunately, most patients present late in the course of their disease and, at the time of diagnosis, only 10 to 25\% of patients will be eligible for potentially curative resection. Efforts must be oriented towards an early diagnosis and towards reliably identifying patients who can really benefit from major surgery. A suspected pancreatic tumor can be a difficult challenge for the clinician. In the last ten years, we have witnessed notable technological improvements in radiological and nuclear imaging. Taking this into account, we will try to delineate the new role of endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} in pancreatic tumor imaging and to place {EUS} in a shareable diagnostic and staging algorithm. To date, the most accurate imaging techniques for pancreatic neoplasms remain contrast-enhanced computed tomography and {EUS.} {EUS} has the highest accuracy in detecting small lesions, in assessing tumor size and lymph node involvement, but helical {CT} must still be the first choice in patients with a suspected pancreatic tumor. However, after this first step, there is a place for {EUS} as a second diagnostic level in several cases: negative results on {CT} scan and persistent strong clinical suspicion of pancreatic cancer, doubtful results on {CT} scans or the need for cytohistological confirmation. In the near future, there will be great opportunities for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic {EUS} and pancreatic cancer could be the best testing ground.},

{METHODS:} The authors analyzed data from the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study {II} ({CPS-II)} Nutrition Cohort to examine the association between pancreatic cancer and glycemic load, glycemic index ({GI)}, and intake of carbohydrates. Diet was assessed among 124,907 men and women who were cancer-free and non-diabetic at baseline in 1992 using a validated 68-item food frequency questionnaire ({FFQ).} During 9 years of follow-up, 401 incident pancreatic cancer cases were identified. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to compute hazard rate ratios ({RR)} adjusted for potential confounding factors.
{RESULTS:} We found no association between glycemic load, {GI}, or carbohydrate intake and risk of pancreatic cancer in this population. The hazard rate ratio ({RR)} was 1.01 (95\% {CI} 0.75-1.37, trend P=0.80) for glycemic load, 0.92 (95\% {CI} 0.68-1.24) for {GI}, and 1.10 (95\% {CI} 0.80-1.51) for carbohydrate intake among men and women in the highest quintile compared to the lowest quintile of each measure. We also found no significant association between these measures and pancreatic cancer risk among individuals who show a greater susceptibility towards insulin insensitivity, such as those who are overweight or more sedentary.

	abstract = {The most important issues in pancreatic imaging are the detection and staging of pancreatic cancer, differentiation between cancer and focal pancreatitis, the characterization of cystic lesions and the search for neuroendocrine tumours. Magnetic resonance ({MR)} units (1.5 T) with strong gradients and a phased-array torso coil should be used, making breath-hold imaging possible in order to avoid motion artifacts. Standard imaging sequences are T1-weighted (T1w) gradient recalled-echo ({GRE)} with and without fat saturation. For T2-weighted (T2w) imaging, axial single-shot turbo spin-echo ({TSE)} and coronal/oblique {MR} cholangio-pancreatography ({MRCP)} pulse sequences are preferable. As contrast agents either gadolinium agents or mangafodipir trisodium are used. Dynamic gadolinium-enhanced T1w fatsat {3D} {GRE} images are helpful to delineate vessel infiltration by adenocarcinoma and to assess the aetiology of cystic masses. Mangafodipir-enhanced {MRI} has been found to be superior to helical computed tomography ({CT)} in the detection of small cancers and in the delineation of liver metastases. In cases of an equivocal pancreatic mass the presence of the "duct penetrating sign" at {MRCP} (i.e., the duct traversing the mass) is suggestive of an inflammatory pseudotumour. Hypoattenuation due to focal fatty infiltration may mimic a tumour at {CT}, but in-phase and opposedphased T1w imaging readily depicts the fat. Multi-detector {CT} has gained increasing popularity for pancreatic imaging because of the {3D} visualization of the peripancreatic vessels. However, {MR} imaging is excellent in the delineation of small pancreatic tumours. Due to its superior soft tissue contrast, {MR} imaging is also the method of choice in the differential diagnosis between tumours and tumour-simulating conditions in patients with equivocal {CT} and to assess cystic lesions.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} This study assessed the value of image fusion with ({18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron} emission tomography ({FDG-PET)} and magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} in patients suspected of having pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} 32 patients (12 women, 20 men; age 24-79 years; mean 56.6 years) were included. All patients underwent whole-body {FDG-PET} examinations and contrast-enhanced {MRI.} Image fusion used a semiautomatic voxel-based algorithm. Separate reading, side-by-side analysis and evaluation of fused {PET/MRI} images were performed. Results were correlated to histopathology (n = 30), or clinical follow-up (n = 2).
{RESULTS:} 15/32 patients had pancreas cancer and 17/32 patients benign disease. The sensitivity and specificity for cancer detection by {FDG-PET} were 93 and 41\% for visual and 86 and 58\% for semiquantitative analysis whereas {MRI} achieved 100 and 76\% respectively. Topographical assignment of {PET} foci by image fusion was superior to side-by-side analysis in 11/39 (28\%) foci (in 8/32 patients). However, a true impact on therapeutic strategy was observed only in 1/8 patients as the presence of multiple metastases, irresectable primaries or medical reasons for inoperability prevented a curative setting.
{CONCLUSION:} Compared to side-by-side analysis, {PET/MRI} image fusion improves the anatomical assignment and interpretation of {FDG} foci. The therapeutic benefit for the patient however is limited in patients with multiple lesions or incurable primaries.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} A 5 year retrospective analysis of percutaneous core biopsies of pancreatic masses and their {CT} features was undertaken. Data were retrieved from surgical/pathology databases; medical records and {CT} reports and images.
{RESULTS:} Three hundred and three patients underwent 372 biopsies; 56 of 87 patients had repeat biopsies. Malignancy was diagnosed in 276 patients, with ductal adenocarcinoma in 259 (85\%). Final sensitivity of percutaneous biopsy for diagnosing pancreatic neoplasms was 90\%; for repeat biopsy it was 87\%. Complications occurred in 17 (4.6\%) patients, in three of whom the complications were major (1\%): one abscess, one duodenal perforation, one large retroperitoneal bleed. {CT} features typical of ductal adenocarcinoma were: hypovascular pancreatic mass with bile and/or pancreatic duct dilatation. Atypical {CT} features were: isodense or hypervascular mass, calcification, non-dilated ducts, cystic change, and extensive lymphadenopathy.

Adenocarcinomas are often hypovascularized as compared to the surrounding tissue. On the other hand, neuroendocrine tumors are hypervascularized lesions. Masses associated with pancreatitis have a different vascularization pattern depending on the degree of inflammation and necrosis. Cystadenomas frequently show many vessels along fibrotic strands. Data from prospective studies have demonstrated that based on these imaging criteria, the sensitivity and the specificity of echo-enhanced sonography in diagnosing the degree of differentiation of pancreatic masses are equal to, or greater than, 85\% and 90\%, respectively. In conclusion, pancreatic tumors have a different vascularization pattern in echo-enhanced ultrasound. These characteristics can be used with high a diagnostic accuracy for differentiation.},

Regulatory T cells ({Foxp3CD4} T cells including {CD4CD25} T cells and {CD4CD25} T cells) play important roles in tumor immunity. This study aimed to investigate whether regulatory T cells participate in metastasis.
{METHODS:} Peripheral blood was withdrawn from {PC} patients, as well as healthy volunteer donors as controls. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells ({PBMCs)} were subjected to {FACScan} analysis after labeling with anti-{CD4}, anti-{CD25}, and anti-Foxp3 antibodies. Tumor markers, including {DUPAN2} and {CA19-9}, surface markers, such as the {CD4/CD8} ratio, and the {CD57} cell population were assessed.

The vascular and perfusion image phases of the tumors were evaluated and compared with the findings of contrast-enhanced computed tomography.
{RESULTS:} Contrast-enhanced ultrasonography showed tumor vessels around and/or in the tumor at the vascular image phase in 79\% of pancreatic cancer patients (42/53). At the perfusion image phase, 96\% of pancreatic cancers (51/53) were classified as hypo-enhancement type. However, tiny spotty or irregular heterogeneous enhanced lesions were found in 84\% of hypo-enhanced pancreatic cancer patients (43/51). The presence of small vessels at the vascular image phase was closely correlated with the presence of these intratumor regional enhanced lesions at the perfusion image phase (kappa coefficient=0.42). The sensitivity of contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (100\%) for pancreatic cancer was superior to that of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (91\%), but no significant difference was observed between the two ({McNemar} test: p=0.063).

{PATIENTS:} One hundred ten patients with heterogeneous pancreatic lesions (inflammatory and malignant tumors) treated at a surgical department of a university hospital were analyzed.
{INTERVENTIONS:} Samples for cytological and histological evaluation were taken during ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy or open surgery.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES:} Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of each test in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumors were determined.
{RESULTS:} The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the {CA} 19-9 test were 80.8\%, 89.1\%, 93.7\%, and 89.2\%, respectively.

{METHODS:} All the clinical and radiological features were reviewed retrospectively and analyzed to identify correlations with the histological findings.
{RESULTS:} Vomiting was an initial symptom in all cases, but obstructive jaundice was not inevitable until the disease progresses. Hypotonic duodenography demonstrated severe postbulbar stenosis. Pathological findings of biopsy specimens showed no evidence of malignancy at the early stage. Computed tomography revealed a hypovascular mass. Magnetic resonance imaging indicated a hypointense mass on T1-weighted images and an isointense to slightly hyperintense mass on T2 images. Macroscopically, the stenosis seemed to be the result of a hard yellowish-white tumor invading the duodenal wall. Histopathologically, an adenocarcinoma arising from the groove infiltrated the submucosal layer of the duodenum circumferentially. No cancer cells were found in the mucosa at the early stage. The intrapancreatic common bile duct was involved at the advanced stage.
{CONCLUSIONS:} We believe that these features resulted from the anatomical characteristics of the groove involvement and that the string stricture of the duodenum resulted from invasion of the groove tumor into the submucosal layer around the wall.},

Multidetector row spiral computed tomography is superior to conventional single-detector row spiral computed tomography in the detection and staging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Positron emission tomography is a sensitive but relatively nonspecific diagnostic modality. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography fusion may improve the staging accuracy for pancreatic cancer. Echo-enhanced ultrasound may have an emerging role in evaluating pancreatic masses. Endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration for cytology is the single best method for diagnosis and staging of nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer with a high accuracy for determining tumor resectability. In acute pancreatitis, a modification of the standard computed tomography severity index, which places greater emphasis on extrapancreatic complications, has shown superior correlation with various patient outcome measures. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is still the test of choice for morphological evaluation of chronic pancreatitis, whereas magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography offers a noninvasive alternative in selected patients. Endoscopic ultrasound can be useful for detecting early chronic pancreatitis. Secretin-stimulated imaging techniques may eventually provide a noninvasive method of reliably assessing pancreatic exocrine function.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Informed consent was obtained in 40 patients (21 women, 19 men; mean age, 67.1 years); the institutional review board approved this protocol. Patients were referred for multidetector {CT} because they were suspected of having a pancreatic tumor and were randomized to receive 150 {mL} of nonionic contrast material (300 mg of iodine per milliliter) at a flow rate of 4 {mL/sec} (n = 21) or 8 {mL/sec} (n = 19). Patients underwent dynamic scanning at one level every 2 seconds for 66 seconds after intravenous administration of contrast material. Contrast enhancement of pancreas and tumors was measured with circular regions of interest (analysis of variance and Bonferroni-Holm corrected post hoc t tests).
{RESULTS:} Peak contrast enhancement in pancreas was observed significantly earlier (mean +/- standard deviation, 28.7 seconds +/- 3.5 vs 48.2 seconds +/- 5.3; P {\textless} .05) and was significantly higher (129.0 {HU} +/- 25.7 vs 106.2 {HU} +/- 35.4, P {\textless} .05) with a flow rate of 8 {mL/sec} than with a flow rate of 4 {mL/sec.} Tumor-to-pancreas contrast greater than 40 {HU} lasted significantly longer with a flow rate of 8 {mL/sec} than with a flow rate of 4 {mL/sec} (26.4 seconds +/- 11.9 vs 8.6 seconds +/- 8.3, P {\textless} .05). With a flow rate of 8 {mL/sec}, an individualized scan delay of 19 seconds after aortic transit time revealed higher tumor-to-pancreas contrast than did a fixed scan delay, and tumor conspicuity was better.

Ten of these patients underwent surgical resection at our institution, providing an opportunity to define the morphology of pancreatic precursor lesions in patients with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer. Eight of the 10 pancreata were available and these were entirely submitted for histologic examination. The number of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia ({PanIN)} lesions and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms ({IPMNs)} were compared with age-matched controls. Parenchymal changes were defined. Selected precursor neoplasms from 6 pancreata were microdissected and analyzed for {KRAS} gene mutations. {PanINs} were significantly more common in the 8 cases (mean of 10.7\% of the duct profiles, range 1.0\% to 27.3\%) than in the controls (mean 1.9\%, range 0\% to 9.2\%, P{\textless}0.01). Different {KRAS} gene mutations were identified in separately microdissected precursor lesions in 2 of 6 cases. {IPMNs} were identified in 4 of the 8 cases, including 2 pancreata each having 2 distinct {IPMNs.} Both the {IPMNs} and the {PanINs}, even the low-grade {PanIN-1} lesions, were associated with lobular parenchymal atrophy. Some individuals with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer develop multifocal, noninvasive epithelial precursor lesions of the pancreas. {PanINs} and {IPMNs} produce obstructive lobular atrophy, and this atrophy is likely the source of the chronic pancreatitis-like changes seen in these patients. The multifocal nature of familial pancreatic neoplasia suggests that surveillance of these patients is warranted after partial pancreatectomy.},

Optical coherence tomography within the pancreatic duct appears to be able to differentiate malignant and normal pancreatic ducts. Spectroscopy may prove useful in differentiating focal chronic pancreatitis from malignancy. Multidetector-row computed tomography may provide more accurate information regarding cancer respectability and differentiation between ductal type of intraductal papillary mucinous tumors.

In fact, its non-invasivity, portability, widespread distribution and good clinical results have made it the preferred method for a first imaging approach to patients in a large variety of clinical settings. Ultrasound technology is advancing rapidly, aimed to increase image quality. In particular, increased color-Doppler sensitivity is contributing to the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic disease. Doppler studies are in fact integral part of ultrasound examination of the pancreas evaluating the peripancreatic vascular structures enclose portal vein, splenic artery and vein, superior mesenteric artery and vein, aorta, and inferior vena cava. While flows in all peri-pancreatic vessels are well recognized, only few parenchymal vessels are usually appreciable in normal conditions. Anyway the increased Doppler sensitivity allows the visualization of smaller peri-pancreatic and intra-pancreatic vessels.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} To compare dynamic-contrast enhanced multirow detector computed tomography ({MDCT)} including multiplanar reformatted images ({MPR)} and magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} including magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography images for the detection and assessment of locoregional extension of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Twenty-four patients with and 21 patients without pancreatic adenocarcinoma underwent triple-phase {MDCT} and {MRI.} Three radiologists independently attempted to detect pancreatic adenocarcinoma and assess locoregional extension in 3 sessions. First session involved {MDCT} images. In the second session, radiologists had access to coronal and sagittal {MPR} images together with the axial images ({MDCT} + {MPR).} Third session involved {MR} images. Results were compared with surgical findings using receiver operating characteristic analysis and kappa statistics.
{RESULTS:} Regarding tumor detection, {MDCT} + {MPR} had a significantly higher value for areas under the curve (0.96 +/- 0.02) at receiver operating characteristic analysis compared with those of {MRI} (0.90 +/- 0.03) and {MDCT} (0.85 +/- 0.04). {MDCT} + {MPR} had the highest mean sensitivity (96\%), and {MRI} had the highest mean specificity (98\%). For locoregional extension, {MDCT} + {MPR} showed the highest kappa values of the study for all factors evaluated (range, 0.63-0.86).
{CONCLUSIONS:} In conclusion, multiphasic {MDCT} imaging with {MPR} images was superior to multiphasic {MDCT} imaging without {MPR} images and to comprehensive {MRI} employing 2-D sequences and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography for both the detection and assessment of locoregional extension of pancreatic adenocarcinomas. {MRI} might be used for further lesion characterization regarding its high specificity.},

This paradoxical phenomenon has not been well documented.
{METHODS:} The findings from endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in 207 cases of pancreatic head carcinomas were analyzed with special reference to this unique type of carcinoma. Twenty-five of the patients were found to exhibit no {MPD} dilatation on ultrasonography, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.
{RESULTS:} Pancreatography via the major papilla showed complete obstruction of the {MPD} (112 patients with {MPD} dilatation and 6 without), stenosis (70 and 10, respectively), or no abnormal findings (0 and 9, respectively). In all six patients with complete {MPD} obstruction but without upstream {MPD} dilatation, injection of the minor papilla revealed a non-dilated dorsal pancreatic duct. The size of the obstructive carcinomas with and without {MPD} dilatation was comparable.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Some (3\%) pancreatic head carcinomas are not associated with {MPD} dilatation despite complete obstruction of the Wirsung duct. In such cases, the Santorini duct drains the dorsal pancreatic duct, completely compensating for the obstructed Wirsung duct.

The aim of this study was to compare optical coherence tomography images of the main pancreatic duct with histology and identify the optical coherence tomography pattern of the normal and pathological structure of the main pancreatic duct.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} Multiple sections of neoplastic and non-neoplastic segments of 10 consecutive surgical pancreatic specimens obtained from patients with pancreatic head adenocarcinoma were investigated by optical coherence tomography scanning within 1h of resection. One hundred optical coherence tomography findings were then compared with the corresponding histopathological diagnoses.
{RESULTS:} Main pancreatic duct wall architecture appeared at optical coherence tomography investigation as a three-layer structure with a different back-scattered signal from each layer. Optical coherence tomography imaging was concordant with histology in 81.8\% and 18.75\% of sections with normal tissue and chronic inflammatory changes. The K statistic between the two procedures was equal to 0.059 for non-neoplastic main pancreatic duct wall appearance. In all neoplastic sections optical coherence tomography showed a subverted layer architecture with heterogeneous back-scattering of the signal and was concordant with histology.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Optical coherence tomography provided images of main pancreatic duct wall structure that were concordant with histology in 100\% of cases in presence of neoplastic ductal changes and did not have false-positive or negative results. Optical coherence tomography images were also concordant with histology in about 80\% of cases with normal main pancreatic duct structure; however, the differential diagnosis between normal tissue and chronic pancreatitis or dysplastic changes appeared very difficult.},

{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} Sensitivity and accuracy of {EUS-FNA} versus {CT/US-FNA} for pancreatic cancer.
{RESULTS:} There were 16 true positive ({TP)} by {CT/US-FNA} and 21 {TP} by {EUS-FNA.} Sixteen of the 20 {CT/US-FNA} negative patients crossed over to {EUS-FNA;} 12 underwent {FNA}, 4 had no mass at {EUS.} Seven of the 12 had positive {EUS-FNA.} Eight {EUS-FNA} negative crossed over to {CT/US;} 4 had no mass at {CT/US}, 3 remained true negative throughout follow-up, 1 had chronic pancreatitis at surgery. The sensitivity of {CT/US-FNA} and {EUS-FNA} for detecting malignancy was 62\% and 84\%, respectively. A comparison of the accuracy for {CT/US-FNA} and {EUS-FNA} was not statistically significant (P = .074, chi(2)).
{LIMITATIONS:} Failure to meet target enrollment resulted in an inability to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the 2 modalities.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {EUS-FNA} is numerically (though not quite statistically) superior to {CT/US-FNA} for the diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy.},

	abstract = {{AIM:} To detect the therapeutic effects of chemical destruction of celiac ganglion in patients with pancreatic carcinoma with intractable pain.
{METHODS:} Ninety-seven cases with advanced pancreatic carcinoma received chemical destruction of celiac ganglion-5 {mL} pure alcohol injection around celiac artery under ultrasonic guidance. The changes of visual analogue scale ({VAS)}, serum substance P (Sub P), beta-endopeptide (beta-{EP)} and T-lymphocyte subtypes level were compared between pre- and post-therapy.
{RESULTS:} Successful rate of puncture was 98.7\%, with one failure. No serious complications such as traumatic pancreatitis, pancreatic fistula, abdominal cavity hemorrhage or peritoneal infection occurred. {VAS}, serum Sub P and beta-{EP} level significantly changed after treatment (8.0+/-2.3 vs 4.6+/-2.1, 254.1+/-96.7 vs 182.4+/-77.6, 3.2+/-0.8 vs 8.8+/-2.1, P{\textless}0.01, P{\textless}0.05, P{\textless}0.01) with complete relief rate 54.2\%, partial relief rate 21.9\%, ineffective rate 12.5\% and recurrent rate 10.7\%. The T-lymphocyte subtypes level remarkably increased when compared with that of pre-therapy (46.7+/-3.7 vs 62.5+/-5.5, P{\textless}0.01).
{CONCLUSION:} Our study suggests that chemical destruction of celiac ganglion under ultrasonic guidance is highly safe, and can evidently relieve cancer pain and improve the cellular immunity in patients with advanced pancreatic carcinoma.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Seventy-eight patients underwent {MSCT} with the following technical parameters: collimation: 4x1 mm; pitch 1; 120 {kVp;} 260 {mAs.} The pre-contrast scan was followed by a single acquisition phase in the caudocranial direction from the inferior hepatic margin to the diaphragm with a 60-s delay after {IV} administration of 150 ml of iodinated contrast material at a rate of 3 ml/s. Two radiologists assessed the single images independently. Receiver operating characteristics ({ROC)} curves were obtained for each of the two observers.
{RESULTS:} The final diagnosis was pancreatic cancer in 46 cases and chronic pancreatitis in 32 cases. Areas under the curve ({AZ)} for diagnosis and evaluation of disease resectability were 0.97 and 0.93 for the first observer (p=ns), and 0.97 and 0.90 for the second observer (p=ns). The mean difference in tissue attenuation values between the cancer and normal pancreas was 72 +/- 3 Hounsfield units ({HU).} No statistically significant differences were observed in the degree of opacification between the peripancreatic arteries and veins.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {MSCT} with a single-phase technique is an accurate and reproducible method for diagnosis and evaluation of disease resectability in patients with suspected {PC}, ensuring optimal tumour-to-pancreas contrast and maximal opacification of the main peripancreatic arterial and venous structures.},

{AIMS:} To compare, in a prospective study, optical coherence tomography images of pancreato-biliary ductal system with histology and identify the optical coherence tomography pattern of the normal wall structure of the ducts.
{METHODS:} Multiple sections of non-neoplastic segments of five consecutive ex vivo human pancreatic specimens were investigated by optical coherence tomography scanning within 1h of resection. Sixty optical coherence tomography images were compared with the corresponding histological findings.
{RESULTS:} Optical coherence tomography appearance of normal common bile duct, main pancreatic duct and sphincter of Oddi is characterized by a differentiated three-layer architecture with a regular surface and a homogeneous back-scattered signal, corresponding to the single layer of epithelial cells, the connective-muscular layer and the muscular or acinar structure, respectively. Optical coherence tomography and histology findings were concordant in all cases.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Optical coherence tomography was able to provide in real-time images of wall structure of the normal common bile duct, main pancreatic duct and sphincter of Oddi that are similar to those obtained by histology.

{METHODS:} A total of 37 patients with pancreatic mass or mass-like lesions were examined by unenhanced and {MnDPDP-enhanced} magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI).}
{RESULTS:} {MRI} was obtained 20-40 min after infusion of {MnDPDP} and homogeneous contrast enhancement was observed in normal pancreas parenchyma. In patients with atrophic pancreas there was no enhancement in pancreatic parenchyma on {MnDPDP-enhanced} {MRI.} In 37 patients with 41 pancreatic masses and mass-like lesions, contrast enhancement was observed at 5 lesions on {MnDPDP} enhanced {MRI.} Three of these 5 lesions were focal pancreatitis and the other 2 were adenocarcinoma. No contrast enhancement was determined in 36 pancreatic masses and mass-like lesions in 32 patients.
{CONCLUSION:} {MnDPDP} contrast-enhanced {MRI}, especially in cases with no parenchyma atrophy, can distinguish focal pancreatic lesion margins. Information about the function of pancreatic parenchyma can be obtained out of tumor. {MnDPDP} facilitates staging of pancreatic tumors by detection of metastatic lesions in the liver. In addition, diminished heteregenous uptake of {MnDPDP} in patients with pancreatitis may be helpful in differential diagnosis.},

{OBJECTIVE:} To evaluate the frequency of major complications after {EUS-FNA} of solid pancreatic masses.
{DESIGN:} Prospective cohort study.
{SETTING:} Tertiary University based referral center for pancreatico-biliary disorder.
{PATIENTS:} Consecutive patients who underwent {EUS-FNA} of a solid pancreatic over a 42-month period. All immediate complications were recorded by the endosonographer. Late complications were assessed at 72 hours and at 30-days after the procedure.
{MAIN} {OUTCOMES} {MEASUREMENTS:} Major complications were defined as acute pancreatitis, bleeding, infection, perforation, use of reversal medication, hospitalization or death.
{RESULTS:} A total of 355 consecutive patients with a solid pancreatic mass underwent {EUS} {FNA.} Major complications were encountered in 9 patients (2.54\%, 95\% {CI} 1.17-4.76). Acute pancreatitis occurred in 3 of 355 (0.85 \%, 95\% {CI} 0.17-2.45); 2 patients were hospitalized, and 1 patient recovered with outpatient analgesics. Three patients were admitted for severe pain after the procedure; all were treated with analgesics and subsequently discharged with no sequela. Two patients (0.56\%, 95\% {CI} 0.07-2.02) developed fever and were admitted for intravenous antibiotics; 1 patient recovered with intravenous antibiotics and the other required surgical debridement for necrosis. One patient required the use of reversal medication. Overall, 1.97\% (95\% {CI} 0.80-4.02) of the patients were hospitalized for complications (range 1-16 days).

Using a large nationwide claims database, this study examines the cost of pancreatic cancer beginning with initial diagnosis and the additional costs when disease progresses.
{METHODS:} A retrospective cohort study was conducted using a claims database of 3 million individuals covered by large {US} employers. The study population consisted of patients newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 1999-2000 and a demographically matched control group. Utilization and costs were summarized as monthly means. Changes in cancer severity and treatment over time were used to approximate disease progression and its associated costs.
{RESULTS:} The study included 412 pancreatic cancer patients and 1,236 controls. The mean follow-up time was 7.5 months. Regression-adjusted monthly costs attributable to pancreatic cancer were {USD} 7,279; over 60\% resulted from hospitalizations. Patients with disease progression (over 50\%) incurred an additional {USD} 15,143 per month compared to patients without disease progression.

{METHODS:} Patients were identified by International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision and current procedural terminology codes, respectively, for pancreatic cancer and pancreaticoduodenectomy at a single tertiary referral center between January 1998 and May 2004. Data were collected retrospectively by chart review. Multivariate analysis of potential predictive factors was performed.
{RESULTS:} A total of 150 patients underwent surgery for documented or suspected pancreatic malignancy; 102 did not have a preoperative tissue diagnosis of cancer. Of these, 75 had neoplastic disease at surgery. Average weight loss was greater for those with malignancy (13.5 vs. 4.8 lbs; P = .014) as was mean bilirubin (6.1 vs. 3.3 {mg/dL;} P = .006). In multivariate analysis, a combination of weight loss {\textgreater}20 lbs, bilirubin {\textgreater}3 {mg/dL}, and {CA} 19-9 {\textgreater}37 {U/mL} had both a specificity and positive predictive value of 100\% for predicting malignancy regardless of bile duct abnormalities or mass lesions on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or endoscopic ultrasound, respectively.

The objective of this study was to report our experience with endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS)} in evaluating patients referred for {FP/EP} found on computed tomography ({CT).}
{METHODS:} Patients referred to our center for {EUS} evaluation of {FP/EP} between January 1998 and December 2003 were studied. Patient demographics, clinical history, endoscopic findings, and follow-up were recorded. Multivariate analysis was used to identify predictors of pancreatic malignancy.
{RESULTS:} A total of 50 patients: 46\% (23/50) male, mean age 59 years (range, 18-90) made up our studied population. {EUS} demonstrated normal findings in 42\% (21/50), prominent ventral anlage (embryologic variant) in 14\% (7/50), and chronic pancreatitis in 22\% (11/50). In 22\% (11/50), a suspicious mass was noted and fine-needle aspiration ({FNA)} was performed. Cytology revealed chronic inflammation in 7 patients, while adenocarcinoma was found in the remaining 4. Median follow-up was 27 months, and the diagnosis did not change in any of the 50 patients. There were no procedure-related complications. After multivariant regression analysis, the factors that were statistically associated with malignancy were a {CA19-9} level {\textgreater}300 (P = .0002) and weight loss (P {\textless} .006).
{CONCLUSIONS:} The majority of patients presenting with {FP/EP} had benign disease, but 8\% had pancreatic cancer.

{AIMS} {AND} {METHODS:} To assess the ability of {OCT} to identify the structure of the {MPD}, to distinguish normal and malignant {MPD} epithelium, and to assess intra- and interobserver reproducibility of {OCT} images. Multiple sections of neoplastic and non-neoplastic segments of 10 consecutive surgical pancreatic specimens were obtained from patients with pancreatic head adenocarcinoma who had undergone Whipple resection, and repeated {OCT} radial and longitudinal scanning was done within 1 h of resection and before pathological examination. We compared 249 good-quality images with 100 histopathological sections.
{RESULTS:} {OCT} recognized a definite, different pattern in 82.9\% of tumor-free and in 97.6\% of tumor-involved specimens; sensitivity and specificity for discrimination between adenocarcinoma and normal tissue were 78.6\% and 88.9\%, respectively. Inflammatory and dysplastic changes of the {MPD} showed an {OCT} pattern similar to that of the normal tissue in 53.3\% of images. Overall, intraobserver reproducibility ranged from 85.1\% to 100\% and interobserver reproducibility ranged from 69.9\% to 100\% and from 89.7\% to 100\% for tumor-free and tumor-involved segments, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {OCT} identified the neoplastic and non-neoplastic {MPD} layer structure and appeared to be a reproducible technique. In non-neoplastic conditions, {OCT} appeared unable to differentiate between normal and abnormal tissues in about half of the cases.},

The accuracy of {EUS} in predicting the absence of pancreatic cancer in a large series of patients with a clinical suspicion of pancreatic cancer is not well documented. Our aim was to determine the negative predictive value ({NPV)} of {EUS} in patients with a suspicion of pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} We retrospectively reviewed, from our {EUS} database (between January 1999 and March 2003), 693 patients who were suspected of having pancreatic cancer and had {EUS} examinations. A total of 155 patients were found by {EUS} to have a completely normal pancreas. Indications for {EUS} in these patients included: weight loss/abdominal pain; and/or pancreatic enlargement/fullness on computed tomography ({CT);} and/or bile duct/pancreatic duct narrowing on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; and/or an elevated {CA} 19-9. Follow-up information was obtained in 135/155 (87\%) patients from patient phone calls and/or physician visits and/or {CT} scan. The mean follow-up period was 25 months (range 8-48 months).
{RESULTS:} No patients developed pancreatic cancer during the follow-up period. Following the {EUS} examination, no work-up was required in 119/135 (88\%) of patients. {CT} scan was performed in 16 patients at 6 months post-procedure, none of which showed a pancreatic mass. The {NPV} of {EUS} in excluding pancreatic cancer in those patients with follow-up was 100\%.

Although spiral {CT} is the best noninvasive method for detecting pancreatic cancer, the sensitivity for small masses remains low. It is this group of patients with small masses who may most benefit from surgical resection. Endoscopic ultrasound employs the use of flexible endoscopic devices to perform diagnostic ultrasound imaging and is a more accurate means of detecting pancreatic tumors. The ability to perform cytological aspiration of pancreatic masses via {EUS} is also a major step in the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. This review article will summarize the role of endoscopic ultrasonography in the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer as well as looking at its impact on the management of these malignancies.

	abstract = {The incidence of pancreatic carcinoma is recently increasing but the prognosis remains extremely poor. Widespread awareness of important clues to the diagnosis is particularly important to improve the prognosis. Dilatation of the main pancreatic duct on ultrasonograms and/or {CT} scans, hyperamylasemia incidentally found during routine blood examinations, and recent onset diabetes mellitus must lead to thorough imaging studies of the pancreas. Death from pancreatic carcinoma occurs in 0.2-1.9\% of all diabetic patients, being more than 300 times frequent compared to general population. Diabetes may be the only clinical sign of pancreatic carcinoma in some patients. In our recent study, of 163 diabetic patients selected by several criteria who underwent {ERCP} screening, 12 patients (7.4\%) proved to have pancreatic carcinoma. The prevalence of pancreatic carcinoma was more frequent in those with a recent onset ({\textless}3 years) of diabetes (13.7\% (8/58)) than in those with a longer history ({\textgreater}3 years, 3.8\% (4/105)). Furthermore, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ({IPMN)} is reported to be associated with pancreatic carcinoma. Concomitant carcinoma was found in 9 of our series of 94 patients (9.5\%) who underwent surgical resection of branch duct {IPMN.} Of particular interest is the fact that two of the 9 patients had carcinoma in situ that could be diagnosed only by cytology of the pancreatic juice. {IPMN} may be the only clue to the early diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma presenting with no clinical symptoms or abnormalities on imaging studies.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Nine patients with pathologically proved pancreatic tumors who underwent both xenon {CT} and perfusion {CT} were included. Results: Quantitative {TBF} of pancreatic tumors measured by perfusion {CT} ranged from 22.1 to 196.2 ml/min/100 g (mean+/-{SD}, 52.6+/-54.8 ml/min/100 g). In contrast, those obtained by xenon {CT} ranged from 10.3 to 173.6 ml/min/100 g (mean+/-{SD}, 47.4+/-49.4 ml/min/100 g).

Previous discussions about treatment have mainly dealt with management of various functioning tumours and clinical syndromes of hormone excess. However, hormonal syndromes often occur late with {MEN-1} pancreatic tumours, and when developed indicate presence of metastases in up to 50\% of the patients. Prospective screening is therefore recommended in {MEN-1} with biochemical markers and endoscopic ultrasound for early detection of {PETs}, and early surgery before metastases have developed. Surgery is recommended in patients with or without hormonal syndromes in absence of disseminated liver metastases. The suggested operation includes enucleation of tumours in the head of the pancreas, excision of duodenal gastrinomas together with clearance of lymph node metastases, and distal 80\% subtotal pancreatic resection as prophylaxis against tumour recurrence. This strategy with early and aggressive surgery is believed to reduce the risks for malignant progression.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} Accurate baseline staging is necessary to appropriately treat pancreatic cancer. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical contribution of whole body {FDG-PET} to the detection of distant metastasis in pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} A total of consecutive 42 patients with previously untreated pancreatic cancer were examined. Whole body {FDG-PET} imaging for initial staging was performed with a {3D} acquisition and iterative reconstruction on Siemens {ECAT} {HR+} scanner at 1 hour post 185-200 {MBq} {18F-FDG} injection. {PET} findings were correlated with clinical and radiological data to determine the impact of {PET} on staging.
{RESULTS:} In 16 patients, there were one or more sites of metastasis based on clinical data. {FDG-PET} correctly identified the presence of metastasis in 13 of 16 patients and its absence in 23 of the remaining 26 patients. Thus, {FDG-PET} missed 4 metastatic sites in 4 patients (liver and lung metastasis). {FDG-PET} correctly identified 8 metastatic sites in 7 patients (peritoneal dissemination and liver, bone and supraclavicular lymph node metastasis), which were missed on {CT} imaging. Based on whole body {FDG-PET}, the clinical stage was changed in 5 of 42 patients (11.9\%).

{SUBJECTS} {AND} {METHODS:} Thirty-four patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent surgery were investigated. Sonography was performed with contrast material (Levovist) for all patients before surgery. Pathologic findings were evaluated on the basis of the resected cancer specimens. We compared contrast-enhanced sonography findings with pathologic findings.
{RESULTS:} All tumors that were hyperechoic on contrast-enhanced sonography were papillary adenocarcinoma, and all tumors that were hypoechoic on contrast-enhanced sonography were ductal adenocarcinoma. Among ductal adenocarcinomas, five (71.4\%) of seven tumors for which the size of the hypoechoic area was unchanged on contrast-enhanced sonography had clear tumor margins with no infiltration or inflammation in the margin. In contrast, all tumors for which the size of the hypoechoic area was reduced on contrast-enhanced sonography had unclear tumor margins with infiltration of cancerous cells and inflammation. Nine (90\%) of 10 tumors that showed partial contrast enhancement or a vascular shadow in a hypoechoic area had large or medium-sized vessels within a tumor at pathology. In contrast, only one (4.8\%) of 21 tumors that did not show the vascular shadow in a hypoechoic area had no large or medium-sized vessels in a tumor.
{CONCLUSION:} Contrast-enhanced sonography well reflects the pathologic changes of pancreatic cancer and will provide useful information in a pretreatment evaluation. Further studies with a large number of patients will be required to confirm this finding.},

{METHODS:} The study evaluated 86 patients who were suspected of having pancreatic tumours. {FDG} {PET} imaging (whole body) was performed at 1 h (early) post-injection and repeated 2 h (delayed) after injection only in the abdominal region. Qualitative and semi-quantitative evaluation was performed. The semi-quantitative analysis was performed using the standardized uptake value ({SUV)}, obtained from early and delayed images ({SUVearly} and {SUVdelayed}, respectively). Retention index ({RI)} was calculated according to the equation: ({SUVdelayed-SUVearly)x100/SUVearly.}
{RESULTS:} The final diagnosis was pancreatic cancer in 55 and benign disease in 31 patients. On visual and semi-quantitative analysis, the diagnostic accuracy of {RI} was the highest (88\%). The differences between the {SUVearly}, {SUVdelayed} and {RI} value in both pancreatic cancer and benign disease were significant (P{\textless}0.01). The mean value of {SUVdelayed} was significantly higher than that of {SUVearly} (P{\textless}0.01) in pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, new foci of metastasis were seen in the liver in two patients and in the lymph node in one patient only on delayed images.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The {RI} values obtained using early and delayed {FDG} {PET} may help in evaluating pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, addition of delayed {FDG} {PET} imaging is helpful to identify more lesions in patients with pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} We sought to determine the impact of positron emission tomography/computed tomography ({PET/CT)} on the management of presumed resectable pancreatic cancer and to assess the cost of this new staging procedure.
{SUMMARY} {BACKGROUND} {DATA:} {PET} using {18F-fluorodeoxyglucose} ({FDG)} is increasingly used for the staging of pancreatic cancer, but anatomic information is limited. Integrated {PET/CT} enables optimal anatomic delineation of {PET} findings and identification of {FDG-negative} lesions on computed tomography ({CT)} images and might improve preoperative staging.
{MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS:} Patients with suspected pancreatic cancer who had a {PET/CT} between June 2001 to April 2004 were entered into a prospective database. Routine staging included abdominal {CT}, chest x-ray, and {CA} 19-9 measurement. {FDG-PET/CT} was conducted according to a standardized protocol, and findings were confirmed by histology. Cost benefit analysis was performed based on charged cost of {PET/CT} and pancreatic resection and included the time frame of staging and surgery.
{RESULTS:} Fifty-nine patients with a median age of 61 years (range, 40-80 years) were included in this analysis. Fifty-one patients had lesions in the head and 8 in the tail of the pancreas. The positive and negative predictive values for pancreatic cancer were 91\% and 64\%, respectively. {PET/CT} detected additional distant metastases in 5 and synchronous rectal cancer in 2 patients. {PET/CT} findings changed the management in 16\% of patients with pancreatic cancer deemed resectable after routine staging (P = 0.031) and was cost saving.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {PET/CT} represents an important staging procedure prior to pancreatic resection for cancer, since it significantly improves patient selection and is cost-effective.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} We examined contrast-enhanced harmonic gray-scale sonographic findings of pancreatic carcinoma in relation to the pathological findings in resected specimens to evaluate correlations between observations made by this modality and the pathological findings.
{METHODS:} The pathological findings of surgical specimens obtained from 16 patients were examined in relation to the contrast-enhanced harmonic gray-scale sonography findings. Lesion vascularity was examined by contrast-enhanced harmonic gray-scale sonography from 20 to 50 s after the injection of Levovist (Schering, Berlin, Germany) (early phase), and lesion enhancement was also monitored at approximately 90 s after injection (delayed phase).
{RESULTS:} Contrast-enhanced harmonic gray-scale sonography showed positive enhancement in 12 of the 16 lesions (peripheral tumor region alone, n = 9; entire tumor, n = 3), while the other 4 lesions showed no contrast enhancement in any region. Twelve enhanced regions (9 peripheral tumor region and 3 entire tumor regions) detected by contrast-enhanced harmonic gray-scale sonography showed: (1) mild fibrosis with inflammation, in 10 regions (83\%); (2) the presence of both carcinoma cells and residual acinar cells in 8 (67\%); and (3) presence of relatively large arteries in 2 (17\%). In contrast, 13 non-enhanced regions (4 entire tumor regions and 9 central regions) showed: (1) severe fibrosis in 10 regions (77\%); (2) necrosis in 7 (54\%); and (3) mucin in 4 (31\%).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Contrast-enhanced harmonic gray-scale sonographic findings of pancreatic carcinoma are influenced by interstitial histological features associated with tumor growth.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} To evaluate the performance of endoscopic transmural drainage of pancreatic fluid collections ({PFCs)} in outpatients.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} We retrospectively reviewed 19 consecutive outpatient cases in 18 patients who underwent attempted endoscopic transmural drainage of {PFCs} by a single endoscopist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, {MN}, over a 5-year period (October 1998 to October 2003). All drainages were performed without {EUS-guided} entry, using an aspiration needle and no cautery. Two 10-Fr stents were placed after dilation of the entry site.
{RESULTS:} The study group consisted of 12 men and 6 women (median age, 48 years; range, 28-79 years), with 14 cases of pseudocysts and 5 cases of pancreatic necrosis. Transmural drainage approaches included 13 transgastric, 5 transduodenal, and 1 combined transgastric/transpapillary. Drainage was established in 16 of 19 (84\%) cases. Hospitalization was noted in 6 of 19 (32\%) cases, with median hospitalization duration of 1.5 days (range, 1-19 days). Three patients were hospitalized for overnight observation only. In all instances, the decision to hospitalize was made while the patient was still in recovery. No deaths occurred. Follow-up imaging was available in 15 of 16 (94\%) cases in which drainage was established, demonstrating {PFC} resolution in all 15.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Endoscopic transmural drainage of {PFCs} can be performed safely and effectively in selected outpatients. It is our opinion that outpatient drainage of {PFCs} be considered only by experienced therapeutic endoscopists with readily available inpatient facilities. Future studies should seek to identify predictors of hospitalization and address cost-effectiveness.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The pancreas is a rare primary location of hydatid disease. The purpose of our study is to gain more insight into this entity and to focus on the management and the diagnostic approach to the disease.
{METHODS:} The medical records of 5 patients with hydatid cysts of the pancreas were reviewed.
{RESULTS:} Four of the cysts were primary, while in 1 case a coexisting cyst was found in the liver. The body and tail of the pancreas were the most common locations. Clinical presentation varied according to the anatomic location of the cyst. Abdominal pain, discomfort and vomiting were the main clinical symptoms. One patient presented with obstructive jaundice, while another patient manifested a mild episode of anaphylactic shock. The indirect hemagglutination test was positive in 3 of 4 cases. A computed tomography scan successfully imaged all cysts and calcification of the cystic wall was found in 3 of 4 cases. All patients underwent surgical therapy. Hydatid cysts in the tail of the pancreas were successfully treated with distal pancreatectomy, while cysts in the body and head of pancreas were treated with proper evacuation, pericystectomy and omentoplasty. The postoperative course was uneventful in all patients except 1 who presented a pancreatic fistula and was re-operated. The mean length of hospitalization after surgery was 11-12 (range 10-13) days, except for the patient who needed to be re-operated. No evidence of cyst recurrence was observed during the follow-up period.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Hydatid cystic masses of the upper abdomen might also originate from the pancreas especially in endemic countries. Surgical excision of the entire cystic lesion remains the optimal treatment, offering hope for a complete cure.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Imaging data of 34 patients (23 men, 11 women; age range, 44-78 years) with adenocarcinoma of the colon (n = 27) or adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (n = 7) who had undergone mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced liver {MRI} and whole-body {FDG} {PET} were retrospectively reviewed for the presence and number of liver metastases. Histopathology (n = 25) or follow-up imaging (n = 9) served as the standard of reference. Breath-hold T1-weighted gradient-recalled echo, respiratory-triggered T2-weighted fast spin-echo, and mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced axial fat-saturated high-spatial-resolution (256 x 512) T1-weighted gradient-recalled echo images were obtained on a 1.5-T scanner. {FDG} {PET} was performed after the injection of 15-20 {mCi} (555-740 {MBq)} of {FDG.} The sensitivity, positive predictive value, and accuracy were calculated for each technique. The performances of the two techniques were compared using the Fisher's exact test.
{RESULTS:} Thirty patients had hepatic metastases and four had no hepatic metastases according to the standard of reference. The total number of metastases was 79, including 33 that measured less than 1 cm. Based on a per-patient analysis, {MRI} and {FDG} {PET} showed sensitivities of 96.6\% and 93.3\%, positive predictive values of 100\% and 90.3\%, and accuracies of 97.1\% and 85.3\%, respectively. According to a per-lesion analysis, {MRI} and {FDG} {PET} showed sensitivities of 81.4\% and 67.0\%, positive predictive values of 89.8\% and 81.3\%, and accuracies of 75.5\% and 64.1\%, respectively. {MRI} detected more hepatic metastases than {FDG} {PET} (p = 0.016). Of the 33 subcentimeter lesions confirmed on the standard of reference, all were identified on {MRI}, whereas only 12 were detected on {FDG} {PET} (p = 0.0001).
{CONCLUSION:} In patients with colon and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, high-spatial-resolution mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced liver {MRI} and whole-body {FDG} {PET} were comparable in the detection of patients with liver metastases. {FDG} {PET} provided additional information about extrahepatic disease and was useful in initial staging.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The development of equipment and contrast agents for ultrasound imaging has contributed to major breakthroughs in the diagnosis of pancreatic tumors. We aimed to determine the diagnostic effectiveness of contrast ultrasound with Levovist, using the Agent Detection Imaging ({ADI)} technique, in 50 patients with pancreatic tumors.
{METHODS:} We studied 50 cases of histologically proven pancreatic disease; 39 carcinomas, 2 endocrine tumors, 4 intraductal papillary mucinous carcinomas ({IPMCs)}, and 5 cases of tumor-forming pancreatitis ({TFP).} Vascular and perfusion images of contrast-enhanced ultrasound ({CE-US)} were used for the evaluation of tumor vascularity and parenchymal perfusion of the tumor, respectively. The hemodynamics of the tumor, and the diagnostic capacity of {CE-US} were compared with those shown by computed tomography ({CT).} The histological diagnosis in all cases was made from either biopsy or surgical specimens.
{RESULTS:} Thirty-four cases of pancreatic carcinoma (87\%) showed a hypovascular and hypoperfusion pattern. The endocrine tumors showed a heterogeneous hypervascular and hyperperfusion pattern. All {IPMC} cases showed hypervascularity of the nodules inside the tumors. {TFP} showed an isovascular and homogeneous isoperfusion pattern. When tumors showing a hypovascular or hypoperfusion pattern on {CE-US} were diagnosed as carcinomas, 34 of the 39 carcinomas (87\%) fit this criterion, with a 95\% confidence interval ({CI)} of 73\%-96\%, whereas, on {CT}, 31 of the 39 were diagnosed as carcinoma; (sensitivity, 79\%). The sensitivity and accuracy of {CT} were inferior to those of {CE-US.} Results of comparison between the {CE-US} findings and the histological diagnosis were as follows. The one papillary adenocarcinoma showed a hypervascular and hyperperfusion pattern; the 32 well or moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas showed a hypovascular and hypoperfusion pattern; and in the poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, 2 cases of scirrhous type showed a hypovascular and hypoperfusion pattern, and the 4 cases of medullary type showed an isovascular and isoperfusion pattern.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The differences in vascularity of pancreatic carcinomas depicted by {CE-US} were associated well with differences in histology. {CE-US}, by the {ADI} technique, is useful for the diagnosis of pancreatic tumors.},

Ductal carcinomas are often hypovascularised compared with the surrounding tissue. Neuroendocrine tumours, on the other hand, are hypervascularised lesions. Tumours associated with pancreatitis have a different vascularisation pattern depending on inflammation and necrosis. Cystadenomas frequently have many vessels along the fibrotic strands.
{RESULTS:} Data from prospective studies have demonstrated, on the basis of these imaging criteria, that the sensitivity and specificity of echo-enhanced sonography for differentiation of pancreatic masses are {\textgreater}or=85 and {\textgreater}or=90\%, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Pancreatic tumours have a different vascularisation pattern in echo-enhanced ultrasound. These characteristics can be used with high diagnostic accuracy for differential diagnosis.},

{RESULTS:} A total of 1050 pancreatic {FNAs} were obtained by {EUS} (n = 843), {US} (n = 140), and {CT} (n = 67). On-site assessment was performed in 89.2\% (n = 937) of cases. Findings were as follows: positive for neoplasm 48.9\% (n = 503), negative 29.1\% (n = 306), descriptive 10\% (n = 105), suspicious 5.9\% (n = 62), atypical/inconclusive 4.6\% (n = 48), and nondiagnostic/inadequate 1.5\% (n = 26). Follow-up in the form of histology or at least 6 months of clinical observation was available for 61.2\% (n = 643).

{AIM:} Prospective comparison of linear {EUS} with/without three-dimensional ({3D)} {EUS} for vessel involvement in pancreatic cancer to evaluate the feasibility of linear {3D} ultrasound.
{MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS:} Linear echoendoscopy was used to identify the pancreatic tumor, the tumor-vessel relation and for {EUS-FNA} to obtain tissue diagnosis. Immediately afterwards, {3D} image acquisition was performed using a magnetic tracked {3D} sensor. The acquisition time was 10-20 s.
{RESULTS:} {EUS} results of 22 patients with solid pancreatic lesions were compared to surgical histology. This proved adenocarcinoma in 17 patients and chronic pancreatitis in 5. {EUS} showed {VI} in 10 patients, {VC} in 6, and no vascular involvement ({NVI)} in 6. Additional {3D} evaluation showed {VI} in 6 patients, {VC} in 10, and {NVI} in 6. Surgery proved {VI} in 7 patients, {VC} in 9, and {NVI} in 6. {EUS} showed {VI} in 3/5 patients with chronic pancreatitis, {3D} showed {VC} only, while surgery found two patients to have {VC} and with {NVI.} In two patients with pancreatic cancer, {VI} was diagnosed on two dimensional ({2D)}, but {VC} on {3D} evaluation. Surgery showed {VC} and {VI} in one each. In the {2D}, one patient with {NVI} had {VI} on surgery; and on {3D} one {VC} proved to have {NVI} at surgery. In 1/22 patients the result of {3D} was false negative, while 4/22 were false positives and one false negative in conventional {EUS.}

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} To assess image quality and duct morphology on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ({MRCP)} and also the value of additional T2- and T1-weighted sequences for differentiation of benignity and malignancy in patients with suspected pancreatic tumors.
{MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS:} One-hundred-and-fourteen patients received {MRCP} and unenhanced and contrast material-enhanced {MR} imaging. {MR} results were analyzed independently by two blinded readers, and subsequently correlated with the results from surgery, biopsy, and follow-up. Assessment included the evaluation of image quality, duct visualization and morphology, and the differentiation of pancreatic lesion status (benign versus malignant).
{RESULTS:} Overall, 49 patients had benign final diagnoses, while 65 had a malignant diagnosis. Image quality of single-shot thick-slab {MRCP} was rated significantly better than the {MIP} images of multisection {MRCP.} With {MRCP} alone, the two readers' accuracy in the assessment of pancreatic lesion status was 72\% (95\% {CI}, 64\% to 83\%) and 69\% (95\% {CI}, 56\% to 77\%), respectively; with the addition of T2- and T1-weighted images the accuracy significantly improved to 89\% (95\% {CI}, 82\% to 95\%) and 84\% (95\% {CI}, 77\% to 92\%) for readers 1 and 2, respectively.
{CONCLUSION:} Single-shot thick-slab {MRCP} and multisection {MRCP} provide complementary results; however, single-shot {MRCP} had superior image quality. Moreover, assessment of ductal morphology with {MRCP} alone facilitated the diagnosis of different pathologic conditions of the pancreatobiliary system in the majority of patients. However, with the addition of T2- and T1-weighted sequences the overall diagnostic accuracy was significantly improved and thus we consider that a comprehensive {MR} approach should comprise both {MRCP} techniques and parenchymal sequences.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Metastatic lesions of the pancreas are a rare but important cause of focal pancreatic lesions. The purpose of this study is to describe the {EUS} features, cytologic diagnoses, and clinical impact of a cohort of patients with pancreatic metastases diagnosed by {EUS-guided} {FNA} ({EUS-FNA).}
{METHODS:} Over a 6-year period, in a retrospective, multicenter study, patients had the diagnosis of pancreatic metastases confirmed with {EUS-FNA.} All examinations were performed by one of 5 experienced endosonographers. The {EUS} and the clinical findings of pancreatic metastases were compared with those of a cohort with primary pancreatic malignancy.
{RESULTS:} Thirty-seven patients with possible metastases were identified, and 13 were excluded because of diagnostic uncertainty. The remaining 24 underwent {EUS-FNA} (mean passes 4.1) of a pancreatic mass without complications. Diagnoses included metastases from primary kidney (10), skin (6), lung (4), colon (2), liver (1), and stomach (1) cancer. In 4 (17\%), 16 (67\%), and 24 (100\%) patients, {EUS-FNA} provided the initial diagnosis of malignancy, tumor recurrence, and pancreatic metastases, respectively. Four (17\%) metastases initially were discovered by {EUS} after negative (n = 3) or inconclusive (n = 1) {CT} scans. Compared with primary cancer, pancreatic metastases were more likely to have well-defined margins (46\% vs. 4\%) compared with irregular (94\% vs. 54\%; p {\textless} 0.0001) margins. No statistically significant difference between the two populations was noted for tumor size, echogenicity, consistency, location, lesion number, or number of {FNA} passes performed.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Pancreatic metastases are an important cause of focal pancreatic lesions and may occasionally be discovered during {EUS} examination after previously negative or inconclusive {CT.} Use of immunocytochemistry, when available, may help to confirm a suspected diagnosis. These lesions are more likely to have well-defined {EUS} margins compared with primary pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} To determine the value of fluorine-18-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography ({FDG-PET)} for the detection of recurrent pancreatic cancer in comparison to computed tomography ({CT)} and magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI).}
{METHODS:} Thirty-one patients with suspected recurrence after surgery were included. Inclusion criteria were sudden weight loss, pain or increased {CA} 19-9 levels. {FDG-PET} was performed in all patients. After visual analysis, maximal standardized uptake values ({SUVmax)} were determined by placing regions of interest on the pancreas bed. Additionally, all patients underwent contrast-enhanced multidetector {CT} (n = 14) or {MR} (n = 17) imaging. Positive findings at {FDG-PET} or {CT/MRI} were compared to follow-up.
{RESULTS:} All patients relapsed. Of 25 patients with local recurrences upon follow-up, initial imaging suggested relapse in 23 patients. Of these, {FDG-PET} detected 96\% (22/23) and {CT/MRI} 39\% (9/23). Local {SUVmax} ranged from 2.26 to 16.9 (mean, 6.06). Among 12 liver metastases, {FDG-PET} detected 42\% (5/12). {CT/MRI} detected 92\% (11/12) correctly. Moreover, 7/9 abdominal lesions were malignant upon follow-up of which {FDG-PET} detected 7/7 and {CT/MR} detected none. Additionally, {FDG-PET} detected extra-abdominal metastases in 2 patients.
{CONCLUSION:} In patients suspected of pancreatic cancer relapse; {FDG-PET} reliably detected local recurrences, whereas {CT/MRI} was more sensitive for the detection of hepatic metastases. Furthermore, {FDG-PET} proved to be advantageous for the detection of nonlocoregional and extra-abdominal recurrences.},

	abstract = {Hematopoietic cytokines ({HCs)} can affect the growth and spread of cancer. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated in pancreatic cancer patients the serum levels of selected {HCs}, such as stem cell factor ({SCF)}, interleukin 3 ({IL-3)}, granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor ({GM-CSF)}, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-{CSF)} and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-{CSF)} in relation to a control group and to a group of patients with chronic pancreatitis. Classical tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen ({CEA)} and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 ({CA} 19-9) were also tested. We compared the serum level of cytokines with the tumor stage. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and receiver-operating characteristics ({ROC)} curve for cytokines and classical tumor markers were defined. The cytokines were measured in 48 patients with pancreatic cancer, in 23 patients with chronic pancreatitis and in 40 healthy subjects. {HCs} were determined using {ELISA.} {CEA} and {CA} 19-9 were measured by microparticle enzyme immunoassay. There were significant differences in the levels of circulating {SCF}, {IL-3}, {GM-CSF}, M-{CSF}, {CEA} and {CA} 19-9 in the pancreatic cancer patients compared to the control group. The serum levels of M-{CSF} and tumor markers were significantly higher in pancreatic cancer patients compared to the pancreatitis group. The levels of {SCF}, M-{CSF} and tumor markers were higher in patients with a more advanced tumor stage. The M-{CSF} serum levels in the pancreatitis group correlated positively with the tumor markers tested--{CEA} and {CA} 19-9. The diagnostic sensitivity of {SCF} and specificity of M-{CSF} and tumor markers were the highest. The {SCF} and M-{CSF} areas under the {ROC} curve were greater than the areas for other cytokines. These results suggest the potential usefulness of {HCs} in pancreatic cancer detection; however, further investigations of early-stage pancreatic cancer patients and confirmation by a prospective study are necessary.},

A randomized consensus reading of the {SSFP} data sets was retrospectively conducted by two board-certified radiologists. The presence of pancreatic lesions, local infiltration, and lymph node metastases was evaluated. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated and a receiver operating characteristic ({ROC)} analysis was performed. The overall sensitivity and specificity of {SSFP} were 0.93 and 0.77, respectively. Comparable values were achieved for lymph node detection (0.88/0.91) and assessment of vascular infiltration (0.94/0.91). The mean area under the {ROC} curve (Az) was 0.91. Owing to its potential to detect vascular infiltration and the rapid acquisition time, {SSFP} imaging should be supplemented as part of a standard {MR} protocol of the pancreas.},

{METHODS:} 112 patients with suspected pancreatic cancer underwent {18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose} gamma camera {PET} and computed tomography ({CT)}, of whom 62 also had laparoscopic ultrasonography and 70 underwent abdominal exploration for potential resection. The final diagnosis was malignancy in 78 and benign disease in 34 patients (25 with chronic pancreatitis).
{RESULTS:} The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for {PET} were 73 and 60\% compared to 89 and 65\% for {CT} respectively (Cohen's kappa = 0.59). In 30 patients {CT} was equivocal with cancer in 14 and benign disease in 16. {PET} correctly diagnosed 13 of these patients (cancer in 6 and benign disease in 7), interpreted 4 as equivocal (cancer in 3 and benign disease in 1) but was incorrect in the remaining 13 patients (cancer in 5 and benign disease in 8).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The prognosis of advanced pancreatic cancer is extremely poor and therefore a novel treatment strategy is desired. The authors thus started a prospective study of allogeneic reduced-intensity hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ({RIST)} for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of this approach for such patients.
{METHODS:} Only patients with pathologically proven pancreatic cancer that was locally advanced or metastatic and not amenable to curative resection were included. The conditioning regimen consisted of gemcitabine, fludarabine, and busulfan.
{RESULTS:} In the first stage of this study, the authors treated seven patients. Treatment-related mortality before day 100 was observed in one patient. The median survival after {RIST} was 229 days. An objective response on computed tomographic scan was observed in two patients and another had a tumor marker response. Marked tumor shrinkage was observed in one of the remaining patients after donor lymphocyte infusion. These antitumor effects appeared after the effect of the conditioning regimen had disappeared. In addition, some of these responses were associated with an increase in the serum anticarcinoembryonic antigen antibody level.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Pancreatic cancer appeared to be sensitive to a graft-versus-tumor effect; therefore, a larger clinical study with a refined strategy is warranted.},

{RESULTS:} Irregular peripheral echo, portal vein invasion, superior mesenteric artery/celiac artery invasion, and the presence of ascites were significant predictors of a poorer prognosis by univariate analysis for survival. In resectable cases, {EUS} findings of {MPD} dilatation and portal invasion were significant prognostic predictors by univariate analysis, and {MPD} dilatation was an independent prognostic predictor by multivariate analysis.

	abstract = {The sensitivity of computed tomography ({CT)} in the diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasms and accurate tumor staging has significantly been improved by the use of thin-section multi-detector row {CT} techniques. Greater table speed, improved tube cooling, high resolution imaging and the possibility of isotropic voxels have led to optimal multiplanar reconstruction in any arbitrary plane and particularly along the pancreatic duct and peripancreatic vessels, significantly improving the detection of small pancreatic tumors and surgical resectability where imaging modalities have so far yielded disappointing results. Nonetheless, while multi-detector row {CT} has greatly enhanced the imaging capabilities of {CT}, early diagnosis is practically impossible to achieve, since the tumor remains asymptomatic until the surrounding structures are involved. Furthermore, even when treated with radical surgery, the incidence of recurrence is high and the prognosis of pancreatic carcinoma still remains extremely poor and has not changed over the past years. In this article, the recent technical developments of multi-detector row {CT} in diagnosing pancreatic neoplasms and staging are considered, with special emphasis on multi-detector row {CT} angiography techniques and curved planar reformations. Some remaining challenging problems such as the pre-operative identification and characterization of small hepatic lesions and detection of omental and peritoneal metastasis, the diagnosis of small isoattenuating pancreatic adenocarcinomas and promising strategies to differentiate between pancreatic adenocarcinoma and chronic inflammatory changes are also presented.},

Routine {US} was the least accurate (82.5\%, 67.5\%, and 72.5\%, respectively). The accuracy rates for {CT} and Doppler {US} were similar (88.1\%, 82.5\% and 80.0\%, respectively).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Endoscopic ultrasound is the most accurate method available to stage pancreatic cancer in the preoperative period. However, the advantage of {EUS} over {CT} and {US} does not justify its routine use due to its high cost, low availability, and invasiveness.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Several modalities currently exist for tissue confirmation of suspected pancreatic cancer prior to therapy. Since there is a paucity of cost-minimization studies comparing these different biopsy modalities, we analyzed costs and examined effectiveness of four alternative strategies for diagnosing pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} A decision analysis model of patients with suspected pancreatic cancer was constructed. We analyzed costs, failure rate, testing characteristics, and complication rates of four commonly employed diagnostic modalities: 1) computerized tomography or ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration ({CT/US-FNA)}, 2) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with brushings ({ERCP-B)}, 3) Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy ({EUS-FNA)}, and 4) laparoscopic surgical biopsy. If the first attempt with a particular modality failed, a different modality was employed to identify the most preferable secondary biopsy strategy.
{RESULTS:} This analysis identifies {EUS-FNA} as the preferred initial modality for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Resultant expected costs and strategies in decreasing optimality include: 1) {EUS-FNA} (1,405 dollars), 2) {ERCP-B} (1,432 dollars), 3) {CT/US-FNA} (3,682 dollars), and 4) surgery (17,711 dollars). If a patient presents with obstructive jaundice, decision analysis modeling resulted in a total expected costs of 1,970 dollars if {ERCP-B} is successful at the time of biliary stent placement. Additional analyses to identify the preferred follow-up modality after a failed alternative method showed that {EUS-FNA} is the preferred secondary modality if any of the other three modalities failed first, in both the setting of and absence of obstructive jaundice. One- and two-way sensitivity analysis of the variables shows unchanged results over an acceptable range.
{CONCLUSIONS:} This cost-minimization study illustrates that {EUS-FNA} is the best initial and the preferred secondary alternative method for the diagnosis of suspected pancreatic cancer. In addition to local expertise and availability, costs and diagnostic yield should be considered when choosing an optimal diagnostic strategy.},

{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients with pancreatic metastasis managed in the Paris area between 1990 and 2000.
{RESULTS:} The series analyzed included 22 patients, 10 men and 12 women, mean age 61 years (range: 35-76). The primary tumors were renal-cell carcinoma (N=10), colorectal cancer (N=4), lung cancer (N=4), breast cancer (N=2), cutaneous melanoma (N=1) and ileal carcinoid (N=1). The mean interval between primary treatment and presentation was 73.5 months (range: 2-151). Diagnosis was established because of clinical symptoms (N=15) or during surveillance (N=7). Computed tomography (N=19) and endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} (N=18) mainly showed solitary and hypodense/or hypoechoic masses. Histological diagnosis was obtained before surgery by {EUS-guided} fine needle aspiration (N=6), ultrasound-guided biopsy (N=3) or duodenoscopy (N=3). Among 10 patients with primary renal-cell carcinoma, 7 were treated by surgery. Median global survival was 33 months. Median survival was 61 months in the event of surgical treatment and 20 months in the other patients (ns). Mean survival depended on the type of primary tumor, 61 months for renal-cell carcinoma and 33 for colorectal cancer (P=0.06).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Most pancreatic metastases develop from renal-cell carcinoma and can occur several years after nephrectomy. Histological diagnosis is often obtained before surgery. Surgical resection must be discussed as it can allow long-term survival.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of two different iodine concentrations of the non-ionic contrast agent, Iomeprol, on contrast enhancement in multislice {CT} ({MSCT)} of the pancreas. To achieve this {MSCT} of the pancreas was performed in 50 patients (mean age 57+/-14 years) with suspected or known pancreatic tumours. The patients were randomly assigned to group A (n=25 patients) or group B (n=25 patients). There were no statistically significant differences in age, height or weight between the patients of the two groups. The contrast agent, Iomeprol, was injected with iodine concentrations of 300 mg ml(-1) in group A (130 ml, injection rate 5 ml s(-1)) and 400 mg ml(-1) in group B (98 ml, injection rate 5 ml s(-1)). Arterial and portal venous phase contrast enhancement ({HU)} of the vessels, organs, and pancreatic masses were measured and a qualitative image assessment was performed by two independent readers. In the arterial phase, Iomeprol 400 led to a significantly greater enhancement in the aorta, superior mesenteric artery, coeliac trunk, pancreas, pancreatic carcinomas, kidneys, spleen and wall of the small intestine than Iomeprol 300. Portal venous phase enhancement was significantly greater in the pancreas, pancreatic carcinomas, wall of the small intestine and portal vein with Iomeprol 400. The two independent readers considered Iomeprol 400 superior over Iomeprol 300 concerning technical quality, contribution of the contrast agent to the diagnostic value, and evaluability of vessels in the arterial phase. No differences were found for tumour delineation and evaluability of infiltration of organs adjacent to the pancreas between the two iodine concentrations. In conclusion the higher iodine concentration leads to a higher arterial phase contrast enhancement of large and small arteries in {MSCT} of the pancreas and therefore improves the evaluability of vessels in the arterial phase.},

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} Recently, dual-phase {18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose} ({FDG)} positron emission tomography ({PET)} was shown to be useful in the differentiation between malignant and benign pancreatic lesions. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the value of dual-phase {FDG-PET} as a prognostic parameter in patients with pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} Sixty-five consecutive patients with pancreatic cancer underwent dual-phase {FDG-PET.} Standardised uptake values at 1 h ({SUV1)} and 2 h ({SUV2)} following the injection of {FDG} were determined, and the retention index ({RI)} was calculated by dividing the difference between {SUV2} and {SUV1} by {SUV1.} The prognostic value of {SUV1}, {SUV2} and {RI} was analysed, along with the various clinical and biochemical parameters.
{RESULTS:} Multivariate analysis showed that only three factors had an independent association with longer patient survival: female gender (p{\textless}0.01), {TNM} stage I-{III} (p{\textless}0.05) and {RI{\textgreater}10\%} (p{\textless}0.01). Neither {SUV1} nor {SUV2} showed any prognostic significance. Combination of tumour stage and {RI} allowed more accurate prognostic evaluation. Patients at stage I-{III} with {RI{\textgreater}10\%} survived longer than did patients at the same stage with {RI{\textless}10\%} (15.3 vs 11.5 months, p{\textless}0.01). Patients at stage {IV} with {RI{\textgreater}10\%} had an intermediate prognosis, with a median survival of 9.5 months; patients at stage {IV} with {RI{\textless}10\%} showed the worst prognosis, with a median survival of 4.9 months (p{\textless}0.05).
{CONCLUSION:} {RI} calculated with dual-phase {FDG-PET} can be used not only as a tool for initial diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer but also as a strong independent prognostic parameter that can allow accurate identification of those patients who will benefit from intensive anticancer treatment at different stages of the disease.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} This study was designed to define the diagnostic advantage of computed tomography during arterial portography combined with computed tomography-assisted hepatic arteriography ( {CTAP} + {CTHA)} for preoperative detection of liver metastases secondary to pancreatic cancer compared with that of multidetector computed tomography ({MDCT).}
{METHODS:} From January 2002 to February 2003, we retrospectively studied 19 consecutive patients with pancreatic cancer. {MDCT} was performed on all patients prior to preoperative visceral angiography. Fourteen patients underwent {CTAP} + {CTHA} at the time of preoperative angiography.
{RESULTS:} Liver metastases were identified in 3 patients by means of {MDCT.} Of 14 patients who underwent {CTAP} + {CTHA}, 8 patients (57.1\%) were diagnosed as having liver metastases, which could not be detected by {MDCT.} These tumors missed by {MDCT} ranged from 5 to 15 mm in size. On {CTAP} + {CTHA}, a single nodule in the liver was detected in 2 patients, 2 nodules in 2 patients, 3 lesions in 1 patient, and {\textgreater} or =4 lesions in 3 patients. The sensitivity and specificity of {CTAP} + {CTHA} versus {MDCT} were 75.0\% versus 23.1\% and 66.7\% versus 100\%, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS:} In conclusion, the combination of {CTAP} and {CTHA} is useful to confirm liver metastases before operation for resectable pancreatic cancer because it has higher sensitivity to detect of liver metastases compared with {MDCT.}},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Thirty-four patients (11 females, 23 males, aged 21-75, mean age 57) selected at sonography ({US)} and spiral {CT} ({SCT)} for clinically suspected focal solid pancreatic lesion, were studied between June 2000 and July 2001. Patients eligible for surgery underwent {MR} imaging (1.5 T) before and after infusion of 5 micromol/kg of Mn-{DPDP} (0.5 ml/kg Teslascan, Nycomed Amersham Health, Oslo, Norway). The baseline examination included {FSE} T2-weighted sequences and fat-saturated and non fat-saturated breath-hold gradient-echo T1-weighted sequences ({FMP} {SPGR).} After Teslascan infusion, fat-saturated and non fat-saturated {FMP} {SPGR} sequences were repeated. Thirty of the 34 patients had a definitive diagnosis provided by reference standards such as post-operative histology (22 cases), cytology ({FNAB)} and/or a follow-up period of at least 6 months (8 patients). As regards lesion characterisation, the signal-to-noise ratio ({S/N} ratio) and contrast-to-noise ratio ({C/N} ratio) of lesions compared to the pancreatic parenchyma were calculated using {ROIs} before and after contrast infusion.
{RESULTS:} The definitive diagnosis was pancreatic malignancy in 18 patients, focal pancreatitis in 5 and neuroendocrine tumours in 3. Four patients with suspected lesions at {US} and/or {SCT} were free of focal pancreatic disease. Mn-{DPDP} {MR} identified 17/18 malignancies, 2/3 endocrine neoplasms 5/5 focal pancreatitis; the 4 patients with no pancreatic lesions were correctly identified. The Mn-{DPDP} {MR} accuracy in detecting focal pancreatic solid lesions was 93\%. {MR} missed 1 small adenocarcinoma (the only {pT1} in our group) and 1 insulinoma (with Mn uptake similar to the surrounding parenchyma). Due to the small number of inflammatory lesions included in the study, no significant differences were found in signal intensity and Mn-{DPDP} uptake between focal pancreatitis and neoplasms.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {MR} with Mn-{DPDP} is very accurate in the identification of focal solid pancreatic lesions. Mangafodi-pir is also very useful for excluding the presence of pancreatic lesions suspected at {US} or {CT.} The characterisation of lesions, in particular of inflammatory versus neoplastic lesions, remains problematic and requires further investigation.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical benefit of {PET/CT} image fusion in the diagnostic workup of pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} One hundred four patients with suspected pancreatic lesion underwent triple-phase multidetector {CT} and ({18)F-FDG} {PET} scanning. Voxel-based retrospective registration and fusion of {CT} and {PET} were performed with recently developed software. {CT}, {PET}, and fused images were assessed by 2 radiologists with regard to the detection of malignancies, possible infiltration of adjacent tissue or lymph nodes, or distant metastases.
{RESULTS:} Fusion of {CT} and {PET} images was technically successful in 96.2\%. In 2 cases, paraaortic lymph node infiltration was detected only by image fusion; in a further 8 cases, lymph node metastases were confirmed with improved localization. In 5 patients, additional pancreatic tumors or distant metastases only suspected during {PET} scanning were confirmed. Image fusion improved the sensitivity of malignancy detection from 76.6\% ({CT)} and 84.4\% ({PET)} to 89.1\% (image fusion). Compared with {CT} alone, image fusion increased the sensitivity of detecting tissue infiltration to 68.2\%, but at the cost of decreased specificity.
{CONCLUSION:} The most important supplementary finding supplied by image fusion is a more precise correlation with focal tracer hot spots in {PET.} Image fusion improved the sensitivity of differentiating between benign and malignant pancreatic lesions with no significant change in specificity. All image modalities failed to stage lymph node involvement.},

The purpose of the present study was to compare the use of endoscopic ultrasound, {CT} and mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced {MRI} for the staging of pancreatic malignancy, particularly with respect to determining resectability prior to surgery. Twenty-seven patients referred for the investigation of a suspected pancreatic malignancy were entered into the trial. All patients had contrast-enhanced {CT}, gadolinium and mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced {MRI}, and endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS).} Images were assessed for nodal staging, tumour staging and resectability for each investigation, and the results compared with findings at surgery. The results for the accuracy of {MRI}, {CT} and {EUS}, in detecting T4 disease versus T3 or lower was 78, 79 and 68\%, respectively; nodal involvement was 56, 63 and 69\%, respectively; and overall resectability (including the T stage, presence of involved nodes and metastases) was 83, 76 and 63\%, respectively. There was no significant difference demonstrated between the three tests. The present study suggests that for patients referred for investigation and staging of pancreatic malignancy, {EUS} and {MRI} scanning convey little advantage over contrast-enhanced {CT.} Furthermore, although mangafodipir trisodium improved the conspicuity of pancreatic tumours, it has little influence on T staging.},

	abstract = {{AIM:} To investigate the role of curved planar reformations using multidetector spiral {CT} ({MSCT)} in diagnosis of pancreatic and peripancreatic diseases.
{METHODS:} From October 2001 to September 2003, 47 consecutive patients with pancreatic or peripancreatic diseases, which were confirmed by operation, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and clinical follow-up, were enrolled in this study. {CT} scanning was performed at a {MSCT} with four rows of detector. A set of images with an effective thickness of 1.0-2.0 mm and a gap of 0.5-1.0 mm (50\% overlap) were acquired in all patients for post-processing. Curved planar reformations were carried out by drawing a curved line on transverse source images, coronal or sagittal multiplanar reformations according to certain anatomic structures (such as cholangiopancreatic ducts or peripancreatic vessels) and the position of lesion.
{RESULTS:} With thin collimation, {MSCT} could acquire high-quality curved planar reformations to display the profile of the whole pancreas, to trace the cholangiopancreatic ducts and peripancreatic vessels, and to show the relationship of lesions with pancreas and peripancreatic anatomic structures in one curved plane, which facilitates diagnosis and rapid communication of diagnostic information with referring physicians.
{CONCLUSION:} {MSCT} with thin collimation could be used to create high-quality curved planar reformations in evaluating pancreatic and peripancreatic diseases with pertinent anatomic information and relative pathologic signs to facilitate the diagnosis and enhance communication with the referring physician. Curved planar reformations can serve as supplements for transverse images in diagnosis and management of pancreatic and peripancreatic diseases.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Coded phase inversion harmonic ultrasonography, a newly available sonographic technique, enables visualisation of slow flow in minute vessels in a real time fashion with the use of a sonographic contrast agent containing monosaccharide. Our purpose was to employ this novel technique to observe microvessels in pancreatic tumours.
{SUBJECTS} {AND} {METHODS:} Sixty five patients with suspicious pancreatic tumours received contrast enhanced coded phase inversion harmonic ultrasonography, contrast enhanced computed tomography, and endosonography. Final diagnoses based on histological findings were pancreatic ductal carcinomas in 49 patients, inflammatory pseudotumours with chronic pancreatitis in seven, and endocrine tumours in nine. For contrast enhanced coded harmonic ultrasonography, Levovist, a contrast agent, was injected intravenously as a bolus. When the first microbubble signal appeared in the pancreas, images of the ideal scanning plane were displayed in a real time continuous fashion (vessel images). Subsequently, interval delay scanning (perfusion images) was taken to demonstrate parenchymal flow. Tumour vascularity was evaluated by using the two types of imaging. Sensitivities for depicting pancreatic tumours were compared between three examinations.
{RESULTS:} Contrast enhanced ultrasonography demonstrated tumour vessels in 67\% of pancreatic ductal carcinomas, although most were relatively hypovascular compared with the surrounding pancreatic tissue. The vascular patterns of tumours obtained by contrast enhanced ultrasonography were closely correlated with those obtained by contrast enhanced computed tomography. Values for sensitivity in depicting pancreatic tumours of 2 cm or less in size were 68\% for contrast enhanced computed tomography, 95\% for endosonography, and 95\% for contrast enhanced ultrasonography.
{CONCLUSION:} Contrast enhanced coded phase inversion harmonic ultrasonography successfully visualised fine vessels in pancreatic tumours and may play a pivotal role in the depiction and differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumours.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and image quality of conventional B-mode {US} ({BM)} and phase-inversion tissue harmonic imaging ({PTHI)} regarding pancreatic pathology. In a prospective study, 107 patients, aged between 28 and 85 years, underwent {US} examinations of the pancreas with both {BM} and {PTHI} in a randomly chosen order. As diagnostic reference, either contrast-enhanced {CT} or {MRI} examinations of the upper abdomen were obtained in all patients. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using the Student's t test. Differences in overall image quality, lesion conspicuity, fluid-solid differentiation, and delineation of the pancreatic tail were analyzed using Wilcoxon's signed ranks test and Bowker's symmetry test. Sixteen of 107 examined patients (15\%) were non-diagnostic and excluded due to technical limitations such as abdominal gas. A total of 60 pancreatic lesions (cysts, acute pancreatitis, dilatation of the pancreatic duct, calcifications, and solid tumors) were diagnosed by {CT} or {MRI.} Phase-inversion tissue harmonic imaging had a higher sensitivity of 70\% (14 of 20) than {BM} (60\%; 24 of 40) for the detection of pancreatic lesions; however, the difference was not statistically significant ( p=0.46). In the assessment of lesions {\textless}1 cm of size, {PTHI} had a sensitivity of 70\% and {BM} 46.7\%, whereby the difference again was not statistically significant. Phase-inversion tissue harmonic imaging proved to be superior to {BM} regarding overall image quality ( p{\textless}0.0001), lesion conspicuity ( p=0.0045), and fluid-solid differentiation ( p=0.0002), as well as the delineation of the pancreatic tail ( p{\textless}0.0001). These differences were statistically significant. The statistically significant improvement of image quality with regards to lesion conspicuity, fluid-solid differentiation, and delineation of the pancreatic tail favors the use of {PTHI} when evaluating the pancreas with {US.} Sensitivity for pancreatic lesions is increased with {PTHI} in comparison with conventional sonography ({BM)}, especially in lesions {\textless}1 cm in diameter, although the difference was not statistically significant.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Whether tissue diagnosis is required in the preoperative evaluation of patients with suspected pancreatic cancer remains controversial. We prospectively evaluated the accuracy, safety, and potential impact on surgical intervention of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} in the preoperative evaluation of suspected pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} All patients who underwent {EUS-FNA} at our institution (n = 547) over a 4.5-year period were enrolled. Patients underwent surgical exploration and resection based on their comorbidity status, evidence of resectability based on spiral computed tomography ({CT)} and {EUS} imaging reviewed in a multidisciplinary approach.
{RESULTS:} Of 547 patients enrolled (median age 64 years, 60\% male), 49\% presented with obstructive jaundice. The operating characteristics of {EUS-FNA} of solid pancreatic masses were: sensitivity 95\% (95\% {CI:} 93.2-95.4), specificity 92\% (95\% {CI:} 86.6-95.7), positive predictive value 98\% (95\% {CI:} 97-99), negative predictive value 80\% (95\% {CI:} 74.9-82.7). The overall accuracy of {EUS-FNA} was 94.1\% (95\% {CI:} 92.0-94). Of the 414 true positive patients by {EUS-FNA}, 138 (33\%) were explored. Of patients deemed operable by combined imaging, 42\% had surgical resection. Eighty-two percent of true positive patients were ultimately found inoperable and received palliative therapy or chemotherapy. Of the 94 patients with true negative cytology based on extended follow-up, only 7 (7\%) underwent surgical resection. Of those with false negative diagnoses (n = 24), 5 patients underwent exploration/resection based on detection of mass lesions by {EUS.} The remaining patients had unresectable disease. Mild self-limiting pancreatitis occurred in (0.91\%).
{CONCLUSIONS:} {EUS-FNA} is a safe and highly accurate method for tissue diagnosis in suspected pancreatic cancer. This approach allows for preoperative counseling of patients, minimizing surgeon's operative time in cases of unresectable disease, and avoids surgical biopsies in the majority of patients with inoperable disease. In addition, it allows for conservative management of patients with benign biopsies. We still, however, recommend exploration of patients with clinical scenario suspicious for pancreatic cancer, a mass found on {EUS} or {CT}, but inconclusive or negative cytology.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} This prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the accuracy of a noninvasive "all-in-one" staging method in predicting surgical resectability in patients with pancreatic or periampullary tumors. {SUMMARY} {BACKGROUND} {DATA:} Despite progress in imaging techniques, accurate staging and correct prediction of resectability remains one of the chief problems in the management of pancreatic tumors. Staging algorithms designed to separate operable from inoperable patients to save the latter an unnecessary laparotomy are becoming increasingly complex, expensive, time-consuming, invasive, and not without risks for the patient. {METHODS:} Between August 1996 and February 1997, 58 consecutive patients referred for operation of a pancreatic or periampullary tumor were examined clinically and by 5 staging methods: 1) percutaneous ultrasonography ({US);} 2) ultrafast magnetic resonance imaging ({UMRI);} 3) dual-phase helical computed tomography ({CT);} 4) selective visceral angiography; and 5) endoscopic cholangiopancreatography ({ERCP).} The assessment of resectability by each procedure was verified by surgical exploration and histologic examination. {RESULTS:} The study comprised 40 male and 18 female patients with a median age of 63 years. Thirty-five lesions were located in the pancreatic head (60\%), 11 in the body (19\%), and 1 in the tail of the gland (2\%); there were 9 tumors of the ampulla (16\%) and 2 of the distal common duct (3\%). All five staging methods were completed in 36 patients. For reasons ranging from metallic implants to contrast medium allergy or because investigations already had been performed elsewhere, {US} was completed in 57 (98\%), {UMRI} in 54 (93\%), {CT} in 49 (84\%), angiography in 48 (83\%), and {ERCP} in 49 (84\%) of these 58 patients. Signs of unresectability found were vascular involvement in 22 (38\%), extrapancreatic tumor spread in 16 (26\%), liver metastases in 10 (17\%), lymph node involvement in 6 (10\%), and peritoneal nodules in only 2 patients (3\%). These findings were collated with those of surgical exploration in 47 patients (81 \%) and percutaneous biopsy in 5 (9\%); such invasive verification was deemed unnecessary and therefore unethical in 6 clearly inoperable patients (10\%). In assessing the four main signs of unresectability (extrapancreatic tumor spread, liver metastases, lymph node involvement, and vascular invasion), the overall accuracy of {UMRI} was 95.7\%, 93.5\%, 80.4\%, as compared to 85.1\%, 87.2\%, 76.6\% for {US} and 74.4\%, 87.2\%, 69.2\% for {CT.} In assessing vascular invasion, the sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of angiography were 42.9\%, 100\%, and 68.8\%, respectively. There were 3 complications (12.5\%) after 24 resections, 5 in 17 palliative procedures, and none after 6 explorations only. The hospital stay was 14 days after resection, 13 after palliative bypass, and 6 after exploration alone. There was no operative or hospital mortality in these 58 cases. {CONCLUSIONS:} Although it is by no means 100\% accurate, {UMRI} is equal or even superior to all other staging methods. It probably will replace most of these, because it provides an "all-in-one" investigation avoiding endoscopy, vascular cannulation, allergic reactions, and x-radiation. But because even {UMRI} is not perfect, the final verdict on resectability of a tumor still will depend on surgical exploration in some cases.},

To investigate 64 computed tomography ({CT)} perfusion imaging features of patients with pancreatic cancer and mass-forming chronic pancreatitis.


{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}

Between January 2003 and April 2010, 234 patients with pancreatic mass underwent 64-{CT} perfusion imaging. Among them, the histopathological results of 64 patients were proven to be pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 15 patients were proven to be mass-forming chronic pancreatitis. Additionally, {CT} perfusion imaging was performed in 33 healthy volunteers served as controls. The slice data were processed using {CT} perfusion software. Perfusion parameters including time density curve, blood flow, blood volume, permeability, peak enhancement, and time to peak were recorded.


{RESULTS}

Blood flow was 77\% lower in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma than in controls, 48\% lower in patients with mass-forming chronic pancreatitis than in controls, and 56\% lower in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma than with mass-forming chronic pancreatitis (P {\textless} .016). Blood volume was 65\% lower in pancreatic adenocarcinoma than in controls, 27\% lower in mass-forming chronic pancreatitis than in controls, and 53\% lower in cancer than mass-forming chronic pancreatitis (P {\textless} .016). Permeability was 559\% higher in pancreatic adenocarcinoma than in controls, 821\% higher in mass-forming chronic pancreatitis than in controls, and 28\% lower in cancer than mass-forming chronic pancreatitis (P {\textless} .016). Peak enhancement was 27\% lower and time to peak 23\% longer in pancreatic adenocarcinoma than mass-forming chronic pancreatitis (P {\textless} .016). Time-density curve showed the peak of mass-forming chronic pancreatitis is earlier and higher than that of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and the peak of mass-forming chronic pancreatitis is later and lower than that of controls.


{CONCLUSION}

{CT} perfusion imaging can provide additional quantitative hemodynamic information of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and mass-forming chronic pancreatitis.},

Interobserver agreement between radiologists was evaluated using kappa statistics. {RESULTS:} The mean accuracies for diagnosing {AIP} and {PA} were 68\% and 83\%, respectively. There was moderate agreement between radiologists (kappa, 0.58; P {\textless} 0.0001). The most common findings for {AIP} were common bile duct ({CBD)} stricture (63\%), bile duct wall hyperenhancement (47\%), and diffuse parenchymal enlargement (41\%). The most common findings for {PA} were focal mass (78\%; kappa, 0.58; P {\textless} 0.0001) and pancreatic ductal dilatation (69\%; kappa, 0.7; P {\textless} 0.0001). Findings helpful for diagnosing {AIP} were diffuse enlargement, parenchymal atrophy as well as absence of pancreatic duct dilatation and focal mass. Findings helpful for diagnosing {PA} were focal mass and pancreatic ductal dilatation. Misdiagnosis of {PA} in patients with {AIP} was due to focal mass, pancreatic duct dilatation, and pancreatic atrophy, whereas misdiagnosis of {AIP} in patients with {PA} was due to absence of atrophy, presence of diffuse enlargement, and peripancreatic halo. {CONCLUSIONS:} Diffuse enlargement, hypoenhancement, and characteristic peripancreatic halo are strong indicators for a diagnosis of {AIP.} Radiologists demonstrated moderate agreement in distinguishing {AIP} from {PA} on the basis of {CT} imaging.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT:} {PAM4} is a monoclonal antibody that shows high specificity for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ({PDAC)} and its neoplastic precursor lesions. A {PAM4-based} serum immunoassay is able to detect 71\% of early-stage patients and 91\% with advanced disease. However, approximately 20\% of patients diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis ({CP)} are also positive for circulating {PAM4} antigen. The specificity of the {PAM4} antibody is critical to the interpretation of the serum-based and immunohistochemical assays for detection of {PDAC.}
{OBJECTIVE:} To determine whether {PAM4} can differentiate {PDAC} from nonneoplastic lesions of the pancreas.
{DESIGN:} Tissue microarrays of {PDAC} (N = 43) and surgical specimens from {CP} (N = 32) and benign cystic lesions (N = 19) were evaluated for expression of the {PAM4} biomarker, {MUC1}, {MUC4}, {CEACAM5/6}, and {CA19-9.}
{RESULTS:} {PAM4} and monoclonal antibodies ({MAbs)} to {MUC1}, {MUC4}, {CEACAM5/6}, and {CA19-9} were each reactive with the majority of {PDAC} cases; however, {PAM4} was the only monoclonal antibody not to react with adjacent, nonneoplastic parenchyma. Although {PAM4} labeled 19\% (6 of 32) of {CP} specimens, reactivity was restricted to pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia associated with {CP;} inflamed tissues were negative in all cases. In contrast, {MUC1}, {MUC4}, {CEACAM5/6}, and {CA19-9} were detected in 90\%, 78\%, 97\%, and 100\% of {CP}, respectively, with reactivity also present in nonneoplastic inflamed tissue.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {PAM4} was the only monoclonal antibody able to differentiate {PDAC} (and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia precursor lesions) from benign, nonneoplastic tissues of the pancreas. These results suggest the use of {PAM4} for evaluation of tissue specimens, and support its role as an immunoassay for detection of {PDAC.}},

	abstract = {{AIM:} To evaluate the accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} elastography for differentiating between pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ({PDAC)} and pancreatic inflammatory masses ({PIM).}
{METHODS:} Electronic databases (updated to December 2012) and manual bibliographical searches were carried out. A meta-analysis of all diagnostic clinical trials evaluating the accuracy of {EUS} elastography in differentiating {PDAC} from {PIM} was conducted. Heterogeneity was assessed among the studies. The meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the accuracy of {EUS} elastography in differentiating {PDAC} from {PIM} in homogeneous studies.
{RESULTS:} Ten studies involving 781 patients were included in the analysis. Significant heterogeneity in sensitivity was observed among the studies (Cochran Q test = 24.16, df = 9, P = 0.0041, I (2) = 62.8\%), while heterogeneity in specificity was not observed (Cochran Q test = 5.93, df = 9, P = 0.7473, I (2) = 0.0\%). The area under the curve under the Sports Rights Owners Coalition was 0.8227. Evaluation of heterogeneity suggested that the different diagnostic standards used in the included studies were the source of heterogeneity. In studies using the color pattern as the diagnostic standard, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio ({LR)}, negative {LR} and diagnostic {OR} were 0.99 (0.97-1.00), 0.76 (0.67-0.83), 3.36 (2.39-4.72), 0.03 (0.01-0.07) and 129.96 (47.02-359.16), respectively. In studies using the hue histogram as the diagnostic standard, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive {LR}, negative {LR} and diagnostic {OR} were 0.92 (0.89-0.95), 0.68 (0.57-0.78), 2.84 (2.05-3.93), 0.12 (0.08-0.19) and 24.69 (12.81-47.59), respectively.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {AIM:} Endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} elastography is not used for detection but rather for characterization of solid pancreatic masses. A meta-analysis was used to assess the accuracy of {EUS} elastography for identification of malignant pancreatic masses.
{METHODS:} {PubMed}, the Cochrane Library, and the {ISI} Web of Knowledge were searched. The studies relating to evaluation accuracy of qualitative or quantitative {EUS} elastography for identification of malignant pancreatic masses were collected. Language was limited to English. The sensitivity and specificity were used to examine the accuracy. Clinical utility was evaluated by likelihood ratio scattergram.
{RESULTS:} A total of 10 studies including 893 pancreatic masses (646 malignant, 72.3\%) were analyzed. The summary sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of malignant pancreatic masses were 0.98 (95\% confidence interval [{CI]} 0.93-1.00) and 0.69 (95\% {CI} 0.52-0.82) for qualitative {EUS} elastography, and 0.96 (95\% {CI} 0.86-0.99) and 0.76 (95\% {CI} 0.58-0.87) for quantitative {EUS} elastography, respectively. The hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.94 and 0.93 for qualitative and quantitative {EUS} elastography. The accuracy of quantitative methods was similar to qualitative methods. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were 3.15 and 0.03 for qualitative {EUS} elastography, and 3.94 and 0.05 for quantitative {EUS} elastography, respectively. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were useful for exclusion of presence of malignant pancreatic masses and not for its confirmation.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {EUS} elastography could be used as a good identification tool for benign and malignant pancreatic masses, with its good performance for exclusion of presence of malignant pancreatic masses.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Differentiating pancreatic cancer ({PC)} from normal tissue by computer-aided diagnosis of {EUS} images were quite useful. The current study was designed to investigate the feasibility of using computer-aided diagnostic ({CAD)} techniques to extract {EUS} image parameters for the differential diagnosis of {PC} and chronic pancreatitis ({CP).}
{METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL} {FINDINGS:} This study recruited 262 patients with {PC} and 126 patients with {CP.} Typical {EUS} images were selected from the sample sets. Texture features were extracted from the region of interest using computer-based techniques. Then the distance between class algorithm and sequential forward selection ({SFS)} algorithm were used for a better combination of features; and, later, a support vector machine ({SVM)} predictive model was built, trained, and validated. Overall, 105 features of 9 categories were extracted from the {EUS} images for pattern classification. Of these features, the 16 were selected as a better combination of features. Then, {SVM} predictive model was built and trained. The total cases were randomly divided into a training set and a testing set. The training set was used to train the {SVM}, and the testing set was used to evaluate the performance of the {SVM.} After 200 trials of randomised experiments, the average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, the positive and negative predictive values of pancreatic cancer were 94.2±0.1749\%,96.25±0.4460\%, 93.38±0.2076\%, 92.21±0.4249\% and 96.68±0.1471\%, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:} Digital image processing and computer-aided {EUS} image differentiation technologies are highly accurate and non-invasive. This technology provides a kind of new and valuable diagnostic tool for the clinical determination of {PC.}},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Distinguishing malignant from benign pancreatic tumors is challenging with current imaging techniques. Endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} elastography has further improved the efficacy of {EUS} for characterizing pancreatic lesions.
{AIMS:} To assess, by combining data from existing trials, the accuracy of {EUS} elastography in diagnosing malignant tumors for patients with pancreatic masses.
{METHODS:} All relevant studies published were identified by systematic searching of databases. A meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model to combine study results.
{RESULTS:} Seven studies involving 752 patients were included. The sensitivity of {EUS} elastography for differential diagnosis of solid pancreatic masses was 97 \% (95 \% {CI}, 0.95-0.98), and the specificity was 76 \% (95 \% {CI}, 0.69-0.82). The area under the curve under summary receiver operating characteristic ({SROC)} was 0.9529. The combined positive likelihood ratio was 3.71 (95 \% {CI}, 2.72-5.07), and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.05 (95 \% {CI}, 0.02-0.13).
{CONCLUSION:} Our meta-analysis shows that {EUS} elastography is a useful tool for differential diagnosis of solid pancreatic neoplasms with very high sensitivity and relatively low specificity. The results indicate that {EUS} elastography not only provides information complementary to that from {EUS} but also potentially increases the yield of fine needle aspiration and reduces the number of unnecessary biopsies.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Second-generation intravenous blood-pool ultrasound contrast agents are increasingly used in endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} for characterization of microvascularization, differential diagnosis of benign and malignant focal lesions, as well as improved staging and guidance of therapeutic procedures.
{METHODS:} The aim of our study was to prospectively compare the vascularisation patterns in chronic pseudotumoral pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer using quantitative low mechanical index ({MI)} contrast-enhanced {EUS.} We included 51 patients with chronic pseudotumoral pancreatitis (n = 19) and pancreatic cancer (n = 32). Perfusion imaging started with a bolus injection of Sonovue (2.4 ml), followed by analysis in the early arterial (wash-in) and late venous (wash-out) phase. Perfusion analysis was performed by post-processing of the raw data (time intensity curve [{TIC]} analysis). {TIC} analysis was performed inside the tumor and the pancreatic parenchyma, with depiction of the dynamic vascular pattern generated by specific software. Statistical analysis was performed on raw data extracted from the {TIC} analysis. Final diagnosis was based on a combination of {EUS-FNA}, surgery and follow-up of minimum 6 months in negative cases.
{RESULTS:} The sensitivity and specificity of low {MI} contrast enhanced {EUS} using {TIC} were sensitivity and specificity of low {MI} contrast enhanced {EUS} using {TIC} analysis were 93.75\% (95\% {CI} = 77.77-98.91\%) and 89.47\% (95\% {CI} = 65.46-98.15\%), respectively. Pseudotumoral chronic pancreatitis showed in the majority of cases a hypervascular appearance in the early arterial phase of contrast-enhancement, with a dynamic enhancement pattern similar with the rest of the parenchyma. Statistical analysis of the resulting series of individual intensities revealed no statistically relevant differences (p = .78). Pancreatic adenocarcinoma was usually a hypovascular lesion, showing low contrast-enhancement during the early arterial and also during the late venous phase of contrast-enhancement, also lower than the normal surrounding parenchyma. We found statistically significant differences in values during {TIC} analysis (p {\textless} .001).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Low {MI} contrast enhanced {EUS} technique is expected to improve the differential diagnosis of focal pancreatic lesions. However, further multicentric randomized studies will confirm the exact role of the technique and its place in imaging assessment of focal pancreatic lesions.},

The reported yield of {EUS} elastography for the differentiation of benign and malignant pancreatic masses has shown variable results. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of {EUS} elastography by pooling data of available trials.
{METHODS:} The Medline, {PubMed}, Embase, and Cochrane Central Trials databases were used to retrieve all the studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of {EUS} elastography for the differentiation of benign and malignant pancreatic masses. Pooling was carried out using a fixed-effect model when significant heterogeneity was not present; otherwise, the random-effect model was used. If there were less than four studies using the same diagnostic standard, forest plots were constructed without pooling.
{RESULTS:} In six studies using the qualitative color pattern as the diagnostic standard, the sensitivity was 99\% (95\% confidence interval 98-100\%) and the specificity was 74\% (95\% confidence interval 65-82\%). The area under the curve under the summary receiver-operating characteristic was 0.9624.

Multiple elastographic measurements of the mass lesion and soft-tissue reference areas were undertaken, and the corresponding strain ratios ({SRs)} were calculated.

{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and overall accuracy of quantitative {EUS} elastography for discriminating malignant from benign pancreatic masses.
{RESULTS:} The final diagnoses were primary pancreatic carcinoma (71.2\%), neuroendocrine tumor (10.6\%), metastatic cancer (1.9\%), and pancreatitis (16.3\%). Malignant masses had a higher {SR} (P = .01) and lower mass elasticity (P = .003) than inflammatory ones. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for the detection of pancreatic malignancy of both {SR} and mass elasticity (0.69 and 0.72, respectively) were less favorable than reported recently.

One possible diagnostic approach of so-called early adenocarcinoma is the identification and systematic examination of individuals at risk for this condition. Between 1992 and 2005 we systematically observed 223 individuals diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. In this 14-year period we performed classical biochemical tests, endoscopic ultrasound, {CT} scans and {ERCP.} We also asked about the number of cigarettes smoked per year and classified individuals consuming regularly more than 80 g of alcohol per day for 5 years for men and 50 g of alcohol per day for 5 years for women as having the alcoholic form of chronic pancreatitis. The remaining patients were classified according to the {TIGARO} classification. Alcohol-related etiology was detected in 73.1\% of patients, 21.5\% had the chronic obstructive form and only 5.4\% were classified as idiopathic pancreatitis. Pancreatic carcinoma was detected in 13 patients with chronic pancreatitis (5.8\%), 3 patients were diagnosed with gastric carcinoma and 1 with esophageal carcinoma. Pancreatic malignancy developed mainly in patients with the alcoholic form of pancreatitis (4.5\%). In the 14-year period 11 subjects died, out of which 8 cases were related to pancreatic carcinoma. Pancreatic and extrapancreatic cancer localized in the gastrointestinal tract are serious complications of chronic nonhereditary pancreatitis. Systematic observation of patients with chronic pancreatitis must be performed with the aim of early diagnosis of pancreatic malignancies (but also including other types).},

	abstract = {New tools have recently emerged that further improve the diagnostic performance of high-end endosonography. Whilst elastography has been available for a while, contrast-enhancing techniques are still very young with little experience existing in this field. The latest development is contrast enhanced low mechanical index endosonography ({CELMI-EUS)} which became commercially available at the beginning of 2010. This technique requires contrast-specific software whereas the pre-existing technique of contrast-enhanced high mechanical index endosonography ({CEHMI-EUS)} does not. The aim of this study was to compare these techniques in discriminating between focal chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma. Included in the study were 58 patients with a pancreatic lesion (19 pancreatic cancer and 39 chronic pancreatitis) with a mean age of 60±15 years. All patients were examined by one investigator ({MH).} All methods were performed within one examination and the result of each technique was noted before using the next. The gold standard was pathology following surgery, endoscopic fine-needle puncture, or one-year follow-up when chronic pancreatitis was suspected.

This study shows that, despite the availability of new technologies, {CEHMI-EUS} is still the most reliable method for the differentiation of focal chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma. However, understanding the advantages of the different methods might help to find the optimal indications for the use of the new techniques.},

	abstract = {The {CA} 19-9 assay detects a carbohydrate antigen on multiple protein carriers, some of which may be preferential carriers of the antigen in cancer. We tested the hypothesis that the measurement of the {CA} 19-9 antigen on individual proteins could improve performance over the standard {CA} 19-9 assay. We used antibody arrays to measure the levels of the {CA} 19-9 antigen on multiple proteins in serum or plasma samples from patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma or pancreatitis. Sample sets from three different institutions were examined, comprising 531 individual samples. The measurement of the {CA} 19-9 antigen on any individual protein did not improve upon the performance of the standard {CA} 19-9 assay (82\% sensitivity at 75\% specificity for early-stage cancer), owing to diversity among patients in their {CA} 19-9 protein carriers. However, a subset of cancer patients with no elevation in the standard {CA} 19-9 assay showed elevations of the {CA} 19-9 antigen specifically on the proteins {MUC5AC} or {MUC16} in all sample sets. By combining measurements of the standard {CA} 19-9 assay with detection of {CA} 19-9 on {MUC5AC} and {MUC16}, the sensitivity of cancer detection was improved relative to {CA} 19-9 alone in each sample set, achieving 67-80\% sensitivity at 98\% specificity. This finding demonstrates the value of measuring glycans on specific proteins for improving biomarker performance. Diagnostic tests with improved sensitivity for detecting pancreatic cancer could have important applications for improving the treatment and management of patients suffering from this disease.},

{METHODS:} In a retrospective study, archived {EUS-FNA} material from patients with {AIP} and {PC} at two centers was analyzed for {KRAS} mutations and loss-of-heterozygosity analysis involving 18 microsatellite markers. {KRAS} status and the fractional allelic loss (number of affected microsatellites divided by informative ones) were compared for {AIP} and {PC.}
{RESULTS:} Thirty-two patients with 33 samples were studied. There were 16 patients with {AIP} (17 samples) and 16 patients with {PC.} {DNA} amplification failed in 7 samples.

The patients were randomized into two groups. Ultrasonoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound were performed in both the groups. Group A patients were additionally examined by computed tomography and tumor marker assay, while in the group B, intraoperative ultrasonoscopy with biopsy and urgent histological examination were done. Results of each imaging technique regarding differential diagnosis and cancer stage were compared with the findings of surgical and histological examination. {RESULTS.} Chronic pancreatitis and adenocarcinoma were documented in 58 (37.2\%) and 78 (50\%) patients, respectively. The size of the lesions and clinical presentation were similar in both the groups, but cancer patients were older than patients with pancreatitis (P{\textless}0.001). Preoperatively endosonoscopy had the highest accuracy in assessing differential diagnosis (92.1\%) and adenocarcinoma (91.8\%), whereas computed tomography had the highest accuracy in assessing tumor size (84.5\%) and transabdominal ultrasonography in assessing lymph node involvement (78.9\%) and distant metastases (88.6\%). Intraoperative ultrasound was the most accurate imaging technique in the assessment of differential diagnosis (100\%), adenocarcinoma (98.5\%), extent of primary tumor (84.8\%), lymph node involvement (87.9\%), and distant metastases (100\%). {CONCLUSIONS.} In the differential diagnosis between chronic pancreatitis and adenocarcinoma, preoperative ultrasonography and intraoperative ultrasound are the best imaging methods.

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease that is difficult to diagnose at early stages when curable treatments are effective. Biomarkers that can improve current pancreatic cancer detection would have great value in improving patient management and survival rate. A large scale quantitative proteomics study was performed to search for the plasma protein alterations associated with pancreatic cancer. The enormous complexity of the plasma proteome and the vast dynamic range of protein concentration therein present major challenges for quantitative global profiling of plasma. To address these challenges, multidimensional fractionation at both protein and peptide levels was applied to enhance the depth of proteomics analysis. Employing stringent criteria, more than 1300 proteins total were identified in plasma across 8-orders of magnitude in protein concentration. Differential proteins associated with pancreatic cancer were identified, and their relationship with the proteome of pancreatic tissue and pancreatic juice from our previous studies was discussed. A subgroup of differentially expressed proteins was selected for biomarker testing using an independent cohort of plasma and serum samples from well-diagnosed patients with pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis, and nonpancreatic disease controls. Using {ELISA} methodology, the performance of each of these protein candidates was benchmarked against {CA19-9}, the current gold standard for a pancreatic cancer blood test. A composite marker of {TIMP1} and {ICAM1} demonstrate significantly better performance than {CA19-9} in distinguishing pancreatic cancer from the nonpancreatic disease controls and chronic pancreatitis controls. In addition, protein {AZGP1} was identified as a biomarker candidate for chronic pancreatitis. The discovery and technical challenges associated with plasma-based quantitative proteomics are discussed and may benefit the development of plasma proteomics technology in general. The protein candidates identified in this study provide a biomarker candidate pool for future investigations.},

There are also concerns that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors could cause cancer, given their effects on immune function.
{METHODS:} We examined the {US} Food and Drug Administration's database of reported adverse events for those associated with the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin and the glucagon-like peptide-1 mimetic exenatide, from 2004-2009; data on adverse events associated with 4 other medications were compared as controls. The primary outcomes measures were rates of reported pancreatitis, pancreatic and thyroid cancer, and all cancers associated with sitagliptin or exenatide, compared with other therapies.
{RESULTS:} Use of sitagliptin or exenatide increased the odds ratio for reported pancreatitis 6-fold as compared with other therapies (P{\textless}2×10(-16)). Pancreatic cancer was more commonly reported among patients who took sitagliptin or exenatide as compared with other therapies (P{\textless}.008, P{\textless}9×10(-5)). All other cancers occurred similarly among patients who took sitagliptin compared with other therapies (P=.20).
{CONCLUSIONS:} These data are consistent with case reports and animal studies indicating an increased risk for pancreatitis with glucagon-like peptide-1-based therapy. The findings also raise caution about the potential long-term actions of these drugs to promote pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND/AIMS:} Pancreatic carcinoma belongs to the area of conditions with late diagnosis and there is no effective screening method. One possible approach to diagnosing so called early adenocarcinoma, therefore, lies in the identification and systematic examination of individuals in risk for this condition.
{METHODOLOGY:} Between 1992 and 2005 we systematically observed 223 individuals diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis. In this 14-year period we performed classical biochemical tests, endoscopic ultrasound, {CT} scans and {ERCP}, we asked about the number of cigarettes smoked per year and classified individuals consuming regularly more than 80 g of alcohol per day for 5 years for men and 50 g of alcohol per day for 5 years for women as having the alcoholic form of chronic pancreatitis. The remaining patients were classified according to {TIGARO} classification.
{RESULTS:} Alcohol-related etiology was detected in 73.1\% of patients, 21.5\% had the chronic obstructive form and only 5.4\% were classified as idiopathic pancreatitis. Pancreatic carcinoma was detected in 13 patients with chronic pancreatitis (5.8\%), three patients were diagnosed with gastric carcinoma and one with esophageal carcinoma. Pancreatic malignancy developed mainly in patients with the alcoholic form of pancreatitis (4.5\%). In the 14 year period 11 subjects died, out of which eight cases were related to pancreatic carcinoma.
{CONCLUSION:} Pancreatic and extra-pancreatic cancer localized in the gastrointestinal tract are among the serious complications of chronic nonhereditary pancreatitis. Systematic observation of patients with chronic pancreatitis must be performed with the aim of early diagnosis of pancreatic, but not only pancreatic malignancies.},

{METHODS:} A review of clinic, radiology, and endoscopy records from a 6-year period identified patients with {AIP} initially suspected of having pancreatic cancer. Abdominal computed tomography ({CT)} with intravenous contrast, endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS)}, and/or {ERCP} was performed in each patient. The diagnosis of {AIP} was made histologically and/or cytologically for each patient.
{RESULTS:} Nineteen of 23 patients (83\%) presented with new-onset weight loss, jaundice, or both. Nineteen (83\%) patients had {CT} findings worrisome for pancreatic cancer including: (1) pancreatic enlargement or focal mass, (2) regional lymphadenopathy, and/or (3) vascular invasion. Eighteen patients (78\%) had common bile duct strictures on {ERCP.} {EUS-guided} fine-needle aspiration biopsies excluded pancreatic cancer in all 22 patients who had {EUS} (96\%).

However, {AIP} is a rare disease and its diagnosis carries vastly different therapeutic and prognostic implications compared with that of pancreatic cancer. The clinical challenge is to distinguish {AIP} from pancreatic cancer, because the price of misdiagnosis can be heavy. Recently, two strategies for differentiating {AIP} from pancreatic cancer were published, one from Japan and the other from the United States. The Japanese strategy relies on cross-sectional imaging, endoscopic retrograde pancreatogram, and serum {IgG4.} The American strategy uses imaging ({CT} scan), serology (serum {IgG4)}, and evidence of other organ involvement (on {CT} scan) as the first tier of tests. If the differentiation cannot be made by these methods, a core biopsy of the pancreas, steroid trial, or surgical resection is recommended. The two strategies reflect differences in clinical practice and local preferences in the use of certain diagnostic tests. However, both strategies require thorough familiarity with the diseases and the tests being used.},

{RESULTS:} Patients had chronic pancreatitis (n=70), neuroendocrine tumours (n=14), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (n=11), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (n=4), serous cystadenoma (n=4). Four {CT} findings had a specificity of over 60\% for the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis: parenchymal calcifications, intraductal calcifications, parenchymal atrophy, and cystic lesions.

Follow-up {PET/CT} after steroid therapy was performed for eight patients with autoimmune pancreatitis. After steroid therapy, none of the patients had intense {FDG} uptake by the pancreas or extrapancreatic organs.
{CONCLUSION:} In difficult cases, at {PET/CT} the presence of diffuse uptake of {FDG} by the pancreas or concomitant extrapancreatic uptake by the salivary glands can be used to aid in differentiation of autoimmune pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Pancreatic cancer can be difficult to diagnose. Fine-needle aspiration ({FNA)} biopsies may be negative even when malignancy is present.
{AIMS:} To identify endosonographic features predictive of malignancy that will separate patients into high- and low-risk groups, in whom a negative {FNA} effectively rules out malignancy.
{METHODS:} Patients presenting for endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} evaluation for suspected pancreatic mass were prospectively enrolled. If a mass or abnormal lymph nodes were present, sampling via fine-needle aspiration ({FNA)} was performed. The characteristics of patients with cancer were compared to the characteristics of patients without cancer using Chi-square testing and t-tests.
{RESULTS:} Seventy-three patients were enrolled. Thirty-three patients had cancer and 40 had benign disease. On multivariate analysis, only vascular or organ invasion and dilation of the pancreatic duct ({PD)} were significantly associated with cancer. {PD} dilation was examined as a stand-alone feature. The presence of a dilated {PD} placed patients into a group with a 65\% prevalence of malignancy. In the non-dilated {PD} group, the prevalence of malignancy was only 17\%, and in this group, the negative predictive value of {FNA} was 100\%, compared to an {NPV} of 73\% in the entire cohort.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The most significant negative predictive endosonographic finding in patients with suspected pancreatic cancer is a non-dilated {PD.} If a patient with suspected pancreatic cancer does not have a dilated {PD} and the {FNA} is negative for malignancy, the likelihood of cancer is low.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Precepts about acute pancreatitis, necrotizing pancreatitis, and pancreatic fluid collections or pseudocyst rarely include the impact of pancreatic ductal injuries on their natural course and outcomes. We previously examined and established a system to categorize ductal changes. We sought a unifying concept that may predict course and direct therapies in these complex patients.
{STUDY} {DESIGN:} We use our system categorizing ductal changes in pseudocyst of the pancreas and severe necrotizing pancreatitis (type I, normal duct; type {II}, duct stricture; type {III}, duct occlusion or "disconnected duct"; and type {IV}, chronic pancreatitis). From 1985 to 2006, a policy was implemented of routine imaging (cross-sectional, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography). Clinical outcomes were measured.
{RESULTS:} Among 563 patients with pseudocyst, 142 resolved spontaneously (87\% of type I, 5\% of type {II}, and no type {III}, and 3\% of type {IV).} Percutaneous drainage was successful in 83\% of type I, 49\% of type {II}, and no type {III} or type {IV.} Among 174 patients with severe acute pancreatitis percutaneous drainage was successful in 64\% of type I, 38\% of type {II}, and no type {III.} Operative debridement was required in 39\% of type I and 83\% and 85\% of types {II} and {III}, respectively. Persistent fistula after debridement occurred in 27\%, 54\%, and 85\% of types I, {II}, and {III} ducts, respectively. Late complications correlated with duct injury.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Pancreatic ductal changes predict spontaneous resolution, success of nonoperative measures, and direct therapies in pseudocyst. Ductal changes also predict patients with necrotizing pancreatitis who are most likely to have immediate and delayed complications.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} \& {AIMS:} Autoimmune pancreatitis ({AIP)} and pancreatic cancer ({PaC)} have similar presentations; a diagnostic strategy is needed to distinguish the 2 diseases.
{METHODS:} We compared computed tomography images (for pancreas and other organ involvement), serum {IgG4} levels, histology data, and the response to steroids between patients with {AIP} (n = 48) and those with {PaC} (n = 100).
{RESULTS:} Pancreatic imaging findings stratified patients into 3 groups. Group 1 was highly suggestive of {AIP}, with diffuse pancreatic enlargement without group 3 features (n = 25, 100\% {AIP).} Group 2 was indeterminate, with normal-sized pancreas or focal pancreatic enlargement without group 3 features (n = 20, 75\% {AIP).} Group 3 was highly suggestive of {PaC}, with presence of {\textgreater}1 low-density mass, pancreatic duct cutoff, or upstream pancreatic atrophy (n = 103, 92\% {PaC).} Although all patients in group 1 had {AIP}, only 20 of the 25 patients had increased serum {IgG4} levels and/or other organ involvement. Of the patients in groups 2 and 3 who did not have cancer, all those with serum {IgG4} levels {\textgreater}2-fold the upper limit of normal or a combination of increased serum {IgG4} levels and other organ involvement (n = 15) had {AIP.} In {AIP} subjects without supportive serologic evidence or other organ involvement (n = 14), diagnosis required pancreatic core biopsy (n = 7), steroid trial (n = 5), or resection (n = 2).
{CONCLUSIONS:} {PaC} can be distinguished from {AIP} by pancreatic imaging, measurement of serum {IgG4} levels, and determination of other organ involvement. However, a pancreatic core biopsy, steroid trial, or surgery is required for diagnosis in approximately 30\% of patients with {AIP.}},

{DESIGN:} Retrospective database review.
{SETTING:} Tertiary referral center.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {INTERVENTIONS:} Six hundred and 91 pancreatic {EUS} exams were reviewed. Sixty-nine met inclusion criteria of having been performed for focal enlargement or fullness of the pancreas. Known chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic calcifications, acute pancreatitis, discrete mass on imaging, pancreatic duct dilation (greater than 4 mm) and obstructive jaundice were excluded.

{AIMS:} To assess the frequency of pancreatic cancer in patients with chronic pancreatitis and its correlation with the severity of pancreatitis.
{METHODS:} We evaluated 72 consecutive patients with chronic pancreatitis (2003-2005) diagnosed by clinical criteria, endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)}, computer tomography, and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography. The severity of chronic pancreatitis was assessed by {EUS} (at least 3 criteria for the positive diagnosis). Diagnosis of cancer was confirmed by cytological (smears provided by {EUS-FNA)} or pathological examination (specimen after surgery).
{RESULTS:} Pancreatic cancer was found in 17 (23.6\%) patients with chronic pancreatitis. In patients with severe and moderate chronic pancreatitis cancer was found in 34\% while in patients with mild chronic pancreatitis in 4\% (p=0.0181). The complications in these patients were: pseudocysts (30.6\%), obstructive jaundice (11.1\%), diabetes mellitus (2.8\%), portal hypertension (2.8\%) etc. They were more frequent in the presence of pancreatic cancer. Sensitivity and accuracy of {EUS-FNA} for the diagnosis of cancer in chronic pancreatitis patients were 50\% and 73.7\%, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Severity of chronic pancreatitis seems to play an important role in cancer development. Other factors associated with pancreatic cancer were increasing age and complications (such as obstructive jaundice).

{PATIENTS:} The study group included, in total, 68 patients with normal pancreas (N = 22), chronic pancreatitis (N = 11), pancreatic adenocarcinoma (N = 32), and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (N = 3). A subgroup analysis of 43 cases with focal pancreatic masses was also performed.
{INTERVENTIONS:} A postprocessing software analysis was used to examine the {EUS} elastography movies by calculating hue histograms of each individual image, data that were further subjected to an extended neural network analysis to differentiate benign from malignant patterns.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} To differentiate normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, and neuroendocrine tumors.
{RESULTS:} Based on a cutoff of 175 for the mean hue histogram values recorded on the region of interest, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of differentiation of benign and malignant masses were 91.4\%, 87.9\%, and 89.7\%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values were 88.9\% and 90.6\%, respectively. Multilayer perceptron neural networks with both one and two hidden layers of neurons (3-layer perceptron and 4-layer perceptron) were trained to learn how to classify cases as benign or malignant, and yielded an excellent testing performance of 95\% on average, together with a high training performance that equaled 97\% on average.

{CONCLUSIONS:} {EUS} elastography is a promising method that allows characterization and differentiation of normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer. The currently developed methodology, based on artificial neural network processing of {EUS} elastography digitalized movies, enabled an optimal prediction of the types of pancreatic lesions.

	issn = {1468-3288},
	doi = {10.1136/gut.2008.150979},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Autoimmune pancreatitis ({AIP)} is a peculiar type of chronic pancreatitis that responds dramatically to steroid therapy. To date, there are no worldwide consensus criteria for {AIP.} Different criteria with institutional preference ({HISORt}, revised Kim and the revised Japanese criteria) are being used to diagnose {AIP}, and there is controversy regarding the inclusion of steroid responsiveness in the diagnostic criteria. In contrast to the {HISORt} and revised Kim criteria, the revised Japanese criteria do not include steroid responsiveness as a diagnostic component.
{AIMS:} This study was performed to evaluate whether "a 2-week steroid trial and subsequent assessment of its response" is a useful diagnostic tool for the differentiation of {AIP} from pancreatic cancer. A further aim was to discover the surgical and clinical outcome for a patient who followed the treatment algorithm based on the steroid responsiveness.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} From January 2004 to June 2007, in the setting of clinically suspected {AIP}, 22 consecutive patients with atypical imaging for {AIP}, while not meeting the classic imaging criteria for pancreatic cancer, were challenged to undergo 2 weeks of steroid therapy (0.5 mg/kg of oral prednisolone per day). After the 2-week steroid trial, steroid responsiveness was assessed based on a marked improvement of narrowing of the main pancreatic duct and a reduction of the pancreatic mass. The steroid trial was continued in the case of positive steroid responsiveness, whereas surgical exploration was conducted in the case of negative steroid responsiveness. The final diagnosis was made by surgical exploration or long-term clinical and radiological follow-up.
{RESULTS:} All patients (n = 15) who responded to steroids were diagnosed as having {AIP}, whereas all patients (n = 7) who did not show a response to steroids were confirmed as having pancreatic cancer. Complete resection was possible in all (6/6; 100\%), except one individual who refused surgery.
{CONCLUSION:} In the clinical setting of suspected {AIP} with the continued need for differentiation from pancreatic cancer due to atypical imaging for {AIP}, "a 2-week steroid trial and subsequent assessment of its response" may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of {AIP} without negative consequences for resectable pancreatic cancer. However, a steroid trial should be performed carefully only by specialists in pancreatology.},

{RESULTS:} {MRCP} in the patients with pancreatic carcinoma displayed dilated pancreatic duct with smooth and regular caliber (n=16, 72.7\%), dilated common biliary duct with abrupt rupture in most cases (n=18, 90\%) and intra- and extra-hepatic cholangiectasis (n=12, 42.8\%), and the double-duct sign (n=19, 86.5\%). In the patients with chronic pancreatitis, {MRCP} identified irregular dilation of the pancreatic duct across the whole segment of the lesion (n= 20, 60.6\%), taper of the dilated common bile duct (n=8, 80\%), stones within the pancreatic duct (n=5, 11.9\%), and pancreatic pseudocsyt within the pancreatic duct (n=21, 50\%).
{CONCLUSION:} Cholangiopancreatographic findings of pancreaticobiliary duct dilation are of great value in distinguishing pancreatic carcinoma from chronic pancreatitis.},

Recently, the usefulness of diffusion-weighted {MR} imaging ({DWI)} in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer has been reported in several studies.
{PURPOSE:} To determine whether high-b-value {DWI} can distinguish pancreatic cancer from benign mass-forming chronic pancreatitis.
{MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS:} Twenty pancreatic cancers and four cases of mass-forming chronic pancreatitis were evaluated by high-b-value {DWI} (b=800 s/mm(2)). The signal intensity on {DWI} was visually evaluated, and the isotropic apparent diffusion coefficients ({ADCs)} were measured.
{RESULTS:} All twenty pancreatic cancers showed high signal intensity (18 showed very high, two showed slightly high) on {DWI.} None of the mass-forming chronic pancreatitis cases showed very high intensity (three showed iso to low, one showed slightly high) on {DWI.} The {ADCs} in the pancreatic cancer and mass-forming chronic pancreatitis were 1.38 +/- 0.32 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s and 1.00 +/- 0.18 x 10(-3) mm(2)/s, respectively (P {\textless} 0.05).
{CONCLUSION:} On high-b-value {DWI}, most pancreatic cancers showed very high signal intensity, and may hence be distinguished from benign mass-forming chronic pancreatitis based on our preliminary results.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ({FDG-PET)} has been widely used for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Because autoimmune pancreatitis is easily misdiagnosed as pancreatic cancer and can be tested for by {FDG-PET} analysis based on the presence of suspected pancreatic cancer, we attempted to clarify the differences in {FDG-PET} findings between the two conditions.
{METHODS:} We compared {FDG-PET} findings between 15 patients with autoimmune pancreatitis and 26 patients with pancreatic cancer. The findings were evaluated visually or semiquantitatively using the maximum standardized uptake value and the accumulation pattern of {FDG.}
{RESULTS:} {FDG} uptake was found in all 15 patients with autoimmune pancreatitis, whereas it was found in 19 of 26 patients (73.1\%) with pancreatic cancer. An accumulation pattern characterized by nodular shapes was significantly more frequent in pancreatic cancer, whereas a longitudinal shape indicated autoimmune pancreatitis. Heterogeneous accumulation was found in almost all cases of autoimmune pancreatitis, whereas homogeneous accumulation was found in pancreatic cancer. Significantly more cases of pancreatic cancer showed solitary localization, whereas multiple localization in the pancreas favored the presence of autoimmune pancreatitis. {FDG} uptake by the hilar lymph node was significantly more frequent in autoimmune pancreatitis than in pancreatic cancer, and uptake by the lachrymal gland, salivary gland, biliary duct, retroperitoneal space, and prostate were seen only in autoimmune pancreatitis.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {FDG-PET} is a useful tool for differentiating autoimmune pancreatitis from suspected pancreatic cancer, if the accumulation pattern and extrapancreatic involvement are considered. {IgG4} measurement and other current image tests can further confirm the diagnosis.},

Eight patients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis and 10 patients with pancreatic cancer served as controls.
{RESULTS:} Lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis ({LPSP)} histology was observed in 26\% (5/19) of {US-guided} core biopsy specimens, 33\% (1/3) of open biopsy specimens, and all 4 resection specimens in {AIP} patients.

{OBJECTIVE:} We applied the techniques of {DIA} to {EUS} images of the pancreas to develop a classification model capable of differentiating pancreatic adenocarcinoma from non-neoplastic tissue.
{DESIGN:} Representative regions of interest were digitally selected in {EUS} images of 3 groups of patients with normal pancreas (group I), chronic pancreatitis (group {II)}, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma (group {III).} Texture analyses were then performed by using image analysis software. Principal component analysis ({PCA)} was used for data reduction, and, later, a neural-network-based predictive model was built, trained, and validated.
{SETTING:} Tertiary academic medical center.
{PATIENTS:} Patients undergoing {EUS} of the pancreas.
{RESULTS:} A total of 110, 99, and 110 regions of interest in groups I, {II}, {III}, respectively, were available for analysis. For each region, a total of 256 statistical parameters were extracted. Eleven parameters were subsequently retained by {PCA.} A neural network model was built, trained by using these parameters as input variables for prediction of {PC}, and then validated in the remainder of the data set. This model was very accurate in classifying {PC} with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93.

{CONCLUSIONS:} {DIA} of {EUS} images is accurate in differentiating {PC} from chronic inflammation and normal tissue. With the potential availability of real-time application, {DIA} can develop into a useful clinical diagnostic tool in pancreatic diseases and in certain situations may obviate {EUS-guided} {FNA.}},

Therefore, cases of focal-type {AIP} subjected to surgical intervention for presumptive malignancy might previously have been diagnosed as mass-forming chronic pancreatitis. The aim of this study was to elucidate the incidence of focal-type {AIP} in resected chronic pancreatitis at a single tertiary cancer center.

{RESULTS:} Seven of 15 patients showed {AIP}, and the other 8 patients were diagnosed as having mass-forming chronic pancreatitis not otherwise specified by pathological retrospective examination. In other words, nearly half of the cases of resected chronic pancreatitis that were suspected to be pancreatic carcinoma preoperatively showed focal-type {AIP.} Regarding the characteristic findings of focal-type {AIP}, narrowing of the pancreatic duct on endoscopic retrograde pancreatography ({ERP)} might be diagnostic.

{DESIGN:} Prospective single-center study.
{SETTING:} Academic center of the University of {Witten/Herdecke.}
{PATIENTS:} Twenty patients with normal pancreas, 20 patients with chronic pancreatitis, and 33 patients with focal pancreatic lesion, histologically later proven in 32 of these 33 cases.
{INTERVENTIONS:} Commercially available {US} equipment was used. The elasticity of tissue was reconstructed in real time within a sample area and was translated into a color scale imaging relative tissue elasticity within this area. Representative loops of at least 20 seconds were recorded regarding each region of interest.
{RESULTS:} Adequate elastographic recordings could be obtained in all 73 patients. Patients with hypoechoic and intermediately echogenic normal pancreas revealed a relatively homogeneous elastographic pattern. Thirty-one focal lesions, including 30 neoplasms and most of the chronically inflamed pancreata had a honeycomb pattern dominated by hard strands. This pattern showed analogies to the histologic structure of 10 resected tumors. Other patients with chronic pancreatitis and those with hyperechoic healthy pancreas had miscellaneous elastographic appearances.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {EUS} elastography of the pancreas is feasible and produces plausible results. The examination of homogeneous tissue is impaired by the relative scale used. Chronic pancreatitis and hard tumors cannot be distinguished by elastography, probably because of their similar fibrous structure.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION:} Metabolic imaging using {18F-fluordeoxyglucose} and a ring-positron emission tomography camera is an established method in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic masses. Ring-positron emission tomography cameras, however, are expensive and available in only few specialized centres. The aim of this study was to investigate how far {18F-fluordeoxyglucose} scan with a conventional dual-head gamma-camera could differentiate between benign and malign pancreatic masses.
{MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS:} Forty-one patients (male/female: 25/16; mean age: 64.0 years; range: 41-86 years) with a pancreatic mass detected by ultrasound, computed tomography or {MRI} were included. In all patients {18F-fluordeoxyglucose} scan was performed after overnight fasting and injection of 4 {mCi} {18F-fluordeoxyglucose} using an {ADAC} Vertex {MCD} dual head gamma-camera ({ADAC;} Milpitas, California, {USA)}, equipped with a 5/8-inch {NaI-crystal.} Images were acquired through a 180 degrees grade rotation in the three dimensional mode. The chosen matrix was 128 x 128 x 16, a Butterworthfilter ({ADAC)} was used and data were transferred into visible sinograms via Fourier-Rebinning. Coronar, sagittal and transversal slices of 3.9 mm thickness each were acquired. Focal tracer enhancement was suspicious for a malignoma and therefore regarded as positive, diffuse or no tracer uptake was suspicious for a benign process and was regarded as negative for cancer. {DEFINITION} {OF} {GOLD} {STANDARDS:} A diagnosis of cancer had to be confirmed histologically by specimens obtained by {18G-needle} biopsy, surgical resection or at autopsy. A diagnosis of an inflammatory mass was considered proven, if no carcinoma could be found histologically in the surgically resected mass or at autopsy, or if there was no progression of the disease during a follow-up of at least 12 months.
{RESULTS:} In 22 patients carcinoma was diagnosed (pancreatic cancer: n=17; endocrine tumour: n=3; carcinoma of the common bile duct: n=2). {18F-fluordeoxyglucose} scan showed a focal tracer enhancement in 19 of these 22 patients (sensitivity: 86.4\%). False negative results were acquired in two patients with cancer of the common bile duct and in one patient with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. In 19 patients the final diagnosis was an inflammatory pancreatic mass. {18F-fluordeoxyglucose} scan showed a diffuse tracer enhancement in 15 of these 19 patients (specificity: 78.9\%). False positive results were acquired in three patients whose blood tests showed signs of an acute episode of chronic pancreatitis. Positive and negative predictive values of {18F-fluordeoxyglucose} scan were 82.6\% and 83.3\%, respectively.
{CONCLUSION:} {18F-fluordeoxyglucose} scan with a conventional dual-head gamma-camera is a highly sensitive and specific method in the differential diagnosis of benign and malign pancreatic masses.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} Painless jaundice is one of the most common presentations of pancreatic head cancer. Chronic pancreatitis can also occasionally present with a mass or mass-like process in the pancreatic head, with the subsequent development of jaundice. In this retrospective review, we evaluate the clinical and imaging features of 22 patients presenting with painless jaundice, initially thought to have pancreatic head cancer and ultimately proven to have chronic focal pancreatitis, to determine whether there are any features on cross-sectional imaging to suggest the correct diagnosis.
{METHODS:} Patients (n = 22) were identified from the medical and imaging records of more than 400 patients with an original diagnosis of pancreatic cancer who were seen at our institution from 1995 to 2003. Of the patients, 17 were men and 5 were women (age range 25 to 82 years, mean age 54 years).
{RESULTS:} Initial ultrasound showed a large, hypoechoic, well-defined mass in the pancreatic head, varying in size from 3 to 7.5 cm; 14 of 22 masses were {\textgreater} 5 cm in maximal diameter. Diagnosis of focal pancreatitis was proven by surgical pathology in 14 cases and suggested by percutaneous biopsy in 3 cases; for all patients, prolonged imaging follow-up (at least 1 year) showed no disease progression or evidence of malignancy. The mean follow-up in our study group was 31 months (range 12 to 72 months).
{CONCLUSION:} Male sex, large size of the pancreatic head mass (mean diameter 5.5 cm), and lack of atrophy of the pancreatic body and tail were the only features associated with chronic inflammation rather than neoplasm as an explanation for a pancreatic head mass. Chronic pancreatitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of focal pancreatic masses, even in the absence of supporting clinical evidence.},

{METHODS:} Serum levels of {CEA}, {CA} 19-9, and {CA} 125 were measured by immunoradiometric assay before the treatment in 123 patients with pancreatic carcinoma and 58 patients with a benign pancreatic disease.
{RESULTS:} The sensitivity of {CEA}, {CA} 19-9, and {CA} 125 in the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma was 39.0\%, 81.3\%, and 56.9\%; and specificity was 91.4\%, 75.9\%, and 77.6\%, respectively. Although there was no significant difference between the {CA} 19-9 positivity ratios of the jaundiced (84.3\%) and nonjaundiced (73.5\%) patient subgroups of the pancreatic carcinoma, this ratio was significantly higher in the jaundiced subgroup (64.7\%) than the nonjaundiced subgroup (7.3\%) of the benign pancreatic diseases (P {\textless} 0.001). The {CEA} and {CA} 125 positivity ratios of jaundiced and nonjaundiced subgroups of patients with benign and malignant pancreatic diseases were not significantly different.
{CONCLUSIONS:} In the differential diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma from benign pancreatic diseases, {CA} 19-9 can be useful in the nonjaundiced patients, whereas {CA} 125 provides a limited contribution in jaundiced patients.},

The aim of the study was to assess the accuracy of power Doppler {EUS} for the differential diagnosis between pancreatic cancer and pseudotumoral chronic pancreatitis.
{METHODS:} We included 42 consecutive patients with pancreatic tumor masses (27 men and 15 women) examined by {EUS} between January 2002 and August 2004. Endoscopic ultrasonographic procedures included power Doppler {EUS} as well as {EUS-guided} fine-needle aspiration in all patients. Final diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was confirmed in 29 patients on the basis of a combination of information provided by imaging tests, follow-up of at least 6 months, and laparotomy in 18 patients for diagnostic or palliative reasons.
{RESULTS:} Sensitivity and specificity of the absence of power Doppler signals inside the suggestive pancreatic mass were 93\% and 77\%, respectively, with accuracy of 88\%. Moreover, the addition of the information provided by the presence of peripancreatic collaterals improved the sensitivity and specificity to 97\% and 92\%, with accuracy of 95\%.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Power Doppler {EUS} provides useful information for the differential diagnosis of pancreatic masses. The results were in concordance with previous studies that showed a hypovascular pattern of pancreatic carcinoma, as well as the formation of collaterals in advanced cases due to the invasion of the splenic or portal veins. Further studies of dynamic {EUS} with contrast agents are necessary to better characterize pancreatic masses.},

A malignant lesion was assumed if all criteria were detectable [gold standard endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)-guided} fine needle aspiration cytology, operation]. The criteria of chronic pancreatitis without neoplasia were defined as no detectable vascularisation before injection of {SonoVue}, regular appearance of vessels over a distance of at least 20 mm after injection of {SonoVue} and detection of arterial and venous vessels.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} To determine the differences between the in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-{MRS)} features of chronic focal pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma and to evaluate the possibility of discriminating chronic focal pancreatitis from pancreatic carcinoma by analysis of in vivo H-{MR} spectra.
{METHODS:} The H-{MR} spectra from 36 human pancreases were evaluated in vivo. This series included 15 cases of chronic focal pancreatitis and 21 cases of pancreatic carcinoma. All cases were confirmed histopathologically after surgical resection. The ratios of the peak area (P) of all peaks at 1.6-4.1 ppm to lipid (0.9-1.6 ppm) (P [1.6-4.1 {ppm]/P} [0.9-1.6 ppm]) in the chronic focal pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma groups were evaluated, and the results were compared. The sensitivity and specificity of the analysis were also evaluated by in vivo H-{MR} spectra for discriminating between chronic focal pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma.
{RESULTS:} In vivo H-{MR} spectra showed significantly less lipid in chronic focal pancreatitis than in pancreatic carcinoma. The ratio of P (1.6-4.1 {ppm)/P} (0.9-1.6 ppm) in chronic focal pancreatitis was significantly higher than that in pancreatic carcinoma (P {\textless} 0.05) because of a decreased peak area of lipids. The means +/- {SDs} of P (1.6-4.1 {ppm)/P} (0.9-1.6 ppm) in the chronic focal pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma groups were 2.78 +/- 1.67 and 0.51 +/- 0.49, respectively. Using a value of {\textless}2.5 as positive for pancreatic cancer, the sensitivity and the specificity for pancreatic cancer were 100\% and 53.3\%, respectively.
{CONCLUSION:} Chronic focal pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma can be distinguished from each other by analysis of in vivo H-{MR} spectra, and in vivo H-{MRS} can be a useful method for making a differential diagnosis between chronic focal pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}
Positron emission tomography ({PET)} using {18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose} ({FDG)} has been used for the evaluation of various tumors, but accumulation in inflammatory lesions makes it a controversial modality. The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of delayed scanning in differentiation between malignant and benign lesions in the pancreas.
{METHODS}
Forty-seven patients with suspected pancreatic carcinoma were studied by {FDG-PET.} All patients received approximately 370 megabequerels of {FDG} after a transmission scan, and an emission scan was performed 1 hour and 2 hours later for all patients. A subset of 19 patients was also scanned at 3 hours postinjection. The standardized uptake value ({SUV)} was determined, and the retention index was calculated by dividing the increase in the {SUV} between 1 hour and 2 hours postinjection by the {SUV} at 1 hour postinjection.
{RESULTS}
Of 27 malignant lesions, the {SUVs} of 22 lesions increased at 2 hours postinjection, whereas the {FDG} uptake in 17 of 20 benign lesions decreased. The {SUVs} at 3 hours postinjection were higher than those at 2 hours postinjection in 9 of 14 malignant lesions and in 2 of 5 benign lesions. Malignant lesions showed a higher retention index than benign lesions (mean ± standard deviation: 12.36 ± 13.37 and −7.05 ± 17.28, respectively; P {\textless} 0.0001). Applying an {SUV} of 2.5 at 1 hour postinjection with the cut-off value for the differentiation between malignant and benign lesions caused one false negative result and seven false positive results, with a diagnostic accuracy of 83.0\% (39 of 47 patients). However, combining the retention index with the {SUV} obtained at 2 hours postinjection provided a higher diagnostic accuracy (91.5\%; 43 or 47 patients) than the {SUV} alone. The false negative rate remained constant when the retention index was taken into account.

{CONCLUSIONS}
The current data suggest that delayed {FDG-PET} scanning at 2 hours postinjection may contribute to differentiation between malignant and benign lesions in the pancreas. Cancer 2000;89:2547–54. © 2000 American Cancer Society.},

{METHODOLOGY:} Patients of either gender aged above 18 years who underwent {EUS} guided {FNAC} of pancreatic masses detected on abdominal {CT}, were included in the study. Biphasic abdominal {CT} scans were carried out for all the patients, followed by {EUS} guided {FNAC.} All material aspirated for cytologic evaluation was assessed for sample adequacy on-site, followed by formal examination for diagnostic purposes.
{RESULTS:} The mean age of patients tested was 58.94 ± 12.84 years with age ranging from 23 to 78 years. Regarding gender 23/42 (54.76\%) patients were male and 19/42 (45.24\%) were female. Out of 42 cases, 27 (64\%) cases were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, 4 (9.5\%) as benign, 4 (9.5\%) as mucinous cystic neoplasm, 2 (4.7\%) as chronic pancreatitis, 2 (4.7\%) as non-diagnostic, 2 (4.7\%) as atypical cells seen and 1 (2.38\%) as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The results were in full concordance with radiologic findings.

{METHODS:} A comprehensive review of study on the precision of {EUS-FNA} in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. A random effects model was used to pool the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio ({PLR)}, negative likelihood ratio ({NLR)} and diagnostic odds ratio ({DOR).} A summary receiver-operating characteristic ({SROC)} was constructed to summarize the overall test performance.
{RESULTS:} Thirty-one articles were eligible for the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, {PLR}, {NLR} and {DOR} of {EUS-FNA} in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer were 0.89 (95\% {CI:} 0.88-0.90), 0.96 (95\% {CI:} 0.95-0.97), 16.88 (95\% {CI:} 10.63-26.79), 0.13 ({95\%CI:} 0.10-0.16) and 150.80 ({95\%CI:} 95.94-237.03) respectively.

{METHODS:} Patients who were diagnosed with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic {PC} between February 2006 and September 2011 were selected for this retrospective study. {FNA} biopsy for pancreatic tumors had been performed percutaneously under extracorporeal ultrasound guidance until October 2009; then, beginning in November 2009, {EUS-FNA} has been performed. We reviewed the complete medical records of all patients who met the selection criteria for the following data: sex, age, location and size of the targeted tumor, histological and/or cytological findings, details of puncture procedures, time from day of puncture until day of definitive diagnosis, and details of severe adverse events.
{RESULTS:} Of the 121 patients who met the selection criteria, 46 had a percutaneous biopsy (Group A) and 75 had an {EUS-FNA} biopsy (Group B). Adequate cytological specimens were obtained in 42 Group A patients (91.3\%) and all 75 Group B patients (P = 0.0192), and histological specimens were obtained in 41 Group A patients (89.1\%) and 65 Group B patients (86.7\%). Diagnosis of malignancy by cytology was positive in 33 Group A patients (78.6\%) and 72 Group B patients (94.6\%) (P = 0.0079). Malignancy by both cytology and pathology was found in 43 Group A (93.5\%) and 73 Group B (97.3\%) patients. The mean period from the puncture until the cytological diagnosis in Group B was 1.7 d, which was significantly shorter than that in Group A (4.1 d) (P {\textless} 0.0001). Severe adverse events were experienced in two Group A patients (4.3\%) and in one Group B patient (1.3\%).

The 25-gauge needle ({25G)} might be easier to be manipulated and expected to be associated with fewer complications since it is thinner and more flexible than the 22-gauge needle ({22G)} although obtaining adequate specimens is questioned. In this randomized trial, the authors tried to compare prospectively {25G} and {22G} in diagnostic accuracy, manipulability from the operator's viewpoint and procedure-related complications.
{MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS:} A total of 188 consecutive patients undergoing {EUS-FNA} for solid or cystic pancreatic masses were consecutively enrolled and 94 patients were randomized to either {25G} or {22G} group, respectively.
{RESULTS:} Baseline characteristics were similar except that more masses of {25G} group were located in the head or uncinate process of pancreas than those from {22G} group. Although there was no difference in diagnostic accuracy (89.4\% vs. 88.3\% with p = 0.82), {25G} was easier to be manipulated (p = 0.004) and related with fewer procedure-related complications (10.6\% vs. 3.2\% with p = 0.004).
{CONCLUSIONS:} {25G} can be chosen in preference to {22G} when performing pancreatic {EUS-FNA} because {25G} was significantly superior to {22G} in terms of manipulability and complications although both were effective for accurate diagnosis.},

The aim of this study was to compare the fanning and standard techniques for {EUS} - {FNA} of solid pancreatic masses.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} Consecutive patients with solid pancreatic mass lesions were randomized to undergo {EUS} - {FNA} using either the standard or the fanning technique. The main outcome measure was the median number of passes required to establish diagnosis. The secondary outcome measures were the diagnostic accuracy, technical failure, and complication rate of the two techniques.
{RESULTS:} Of 54 patients, 26 were randomized to the standard technique and 28 to the fanning technique. There was no difference in diagnostic accuracy (76.9 \% vs. 96.4 \%; P = 0.05), technical failure or complication rates (none in either cohort). There was a significant difference in both the number of passes required to establish diagnosis (median 1 [interquartile range 1 - 3] vs. 1 [1 - 1]; P = 0.02) and the percentage of patients in whom a diagnosis was achieved on pass one (57.7 \% vs. 85.7 \%; P = 0.02) between the standard and fanning groups, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The fanning technique of {FNA} was superior to the standard approach because fewer passes were required to establish the diagnosis.

{AIMS:} We aimed to examine post-procedural events and determine risk factors associated with {EUS-FNA} of pancreatic solid lesions.
{METHODS:} This single-center retrospective study included 316 consecutive patients with pancreatic solid lesions who underwent 327 {EUS-FNA} procedures from April 2003 to September 2011. We registered all patients undergoing {EUS-FNA} in the database and retrospectively ascertained the presence/absence of post-procedural adverse events.
{RESULTS:} The incidence of post-procedural adverse events, including moderate to mild pancreatitis, mild abdominal pain, and mild bleeding, was 3.4 \%. Univariate analysis showed that the incidence of post-procedural events was significantly increased in patients with tumors less than or equal to 20 mm in diameter (P {\textless} 0.001), those with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors ({PNET)} (P = 0.012), and patients who had intervening normal pancreas for accessing the lesion (P = 0.048).

Rapid on-site evaluation ({ROSE)} has been reported to improve the accuracy. However, an on-site cytopathologist is not routinely available in many institutions. One of the solutions may be {ROSE} by endosonographer. The aim was to examine whether diagnostic accuracy increases through {ROSE} by endosonographer using our cytological criteria.
{METHODS:} Patients who underwent {EUS-FNA} of solid pancreatic masses from January 2006 to August 2009 (n = 53, period 1) and September 2009 to April 2011 (n = 85, period 2) were retrospectively identified. Before initiating {ROSE} at the start of period 2, two endosonographers underwent training for cytological interpretation, which was focused on four cytological features of pancreatic ductal carcinoma: anisonucleosis, nuclear membrane irregularity, overlapping, and enlargement. During {EUS-FNA} in period 2, endosonographers classified the Diff-Quik smears under three atypical grades and evaluated the adequacy. All diagnoses were made by one pathologist without knowledge of clinical information.
{RESULTS:} The rate of "inconclusive" diagnoses, interpreted as "suspicious," "atypical," and "inadequate for diagnosis" was reduced from 26.4\% in period 1 to 8.2\% in period 2 (P = 0.004). Moreover, diagnostic accuracy was increased from 69.2\% in period 1 to 91.8\% in period 2 (P {\textless} 0.001).

	abstract = {{CONTEXT:} The diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma can be challenging for the pathologist. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided, fine-needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} can be used to obtain samples of pancreatic masses. {UroVysion} fluorescence in situ hybridization ({UFISH)} has been reported to increase the sensitivity and to be very specific for the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma when combined with cytology in the diagnosis of biliary brushings and washings.
{OBJECTIVES:} To determine the sensitivity and specificity of {UFISH} on tissues obtained from pancreatic lesions suggestive of adenocarcinoma obtained by {EUS-FNA}, compared against fine-needle aspiration ({FNA)} results. Additionally, to use patient follow-up data to evaluate {UFISH} results in {FNA} samples that showed significant atypia but did not meet the criteria for malignancy.
{DESIGN:} Sixty consecutive cases of pancreatic {EUS-FNA} from our institution submitted for {UFISH} testing.
{RESULTS:} Polysomic {UFISH} has a sensitivity of 93\% and a specificity of 100\% when compared against {FNA} results. Follow-up studies showed that adding {UFISH} to {FNA} increased the sensitivity for patients with true-positive results from 83\% to 94\% and increased specificity from 85\% to 100\%. For 7 patients with suspicious {FNA} results who had sufficient follow-up, {UFISH} was 100\% sensitive and 100\% specific.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {UFISH} can be used to confirm the diagnosis of malignancy in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Because of the high specificity, polysomic {UFISH} may help establish a diagnosis of malignancy when the {FNA} features are suggestive of, but not conclusive for, malignancy. The most common cause for a false-negative {UFISH} result was insufficient numbers of malignant cells.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION:} A prior study with 22-gauge needles recommended more than seven needle passes for endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy ({EUS-FNA)} of solid pancreatic lesions ({SPL)} without onsite cytopathology for optimal acquisition of cytopathological diagnosis. The feasibility of this recommendation should be re-evaluated considering the later development and popularity of 25-gauge {EUS-FNA} needles. We aimed to determine the optimal number of needle passes for cytopathological specimen acquisition with 25-gauge needles for {EUS-FNA} of {SPL.}
{METHODS:} A preliminary prospective study of 22 patients with an onsite cytopathology technician showed a sensitivity of 93.3\% and a specificity of 100\% with four needle passes that was not statistically different from five needle passes. Based on our preliminary study, we fixed the number of needle passes to four (Group A). As a control group, we carried out sampling in consecutive patients using 25-gauge needles with an onsite cytopathologist (Group B). Sampling rate, diagnostic value and complications were evaluated.
{RESULTS:} We enrolled 20 patients in each group. Sampling rate was higher in Group B (20/20, 100\%) than in Group A (19/20, 95\%), but there was no statistical difference between them (P-value = 0.31). In Group A, sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 100\% among 19. In Group B, sensitivity was 94.1\%, specificity 100\%, accuracy 95\%. There were also no statistical differences between the groups. No complications were seen.
{CONCLUSION:} Our study suggests that four needle passes using a 25-gauge needle may be sufficient for {EUS-FNA} of {SPL} where onsite cytology is not available.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} is an accurate method for cytological confirmation of pancreatic malignancy, but peritoneal dissemination caused by {EUS-FNA} could be a matter of concern because it may lead to poorer prognosis. Our aim was to estimate the risk of peritoneal carcinomatosis by {EUS-FNA} for pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} Two hundred and seventeen patients with cytopathologically proven pancreatic cancer in a tertiary referral center were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into two groups: 161 patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ({ERCP)} alone ({ERCP} group), and 56 patients who had ever undergone {EUS-FNA} ({EUS-FNA} group). Peritoneal carcinomatosis was diagnosed by computed tomography and/or cytology during follow-up. Hazard ratios of factors including {EUS-FNA} for the development of peritoneal carcinomatosis were analyzed by the Cox proportional hazard model.
{RESULTS:} There was no significant difference in baseline characteristics between {ERCP} and {EUS-FNA} groups. Peritoneal carcinomatosis developed in 14.9 \% (24/161) during an average follow-up period of 545 days, and 17.9 \% (10/56) during 599 days among {ERCP} and {EUS-FNA} group, respectively. The {EUS-FNA} was not identified as a significant risk factor with hazard ratios ({HR)} of 1.07 [95 \% confidence interval ({CI)} 0.51-2.25, p = 0.85] by univariate analysis and 1.35 (95 \% {CI} 0.62-2.95, p = 0.45) by multivariate analysis.

	volume = {26},
	issn = {0835-7900},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} with fine-needle aspiration ({FNA)} is often used to assist in the evaluation of pancreatic lesions and may help to diagnose benign versus malignant neoplasms. However, there is a paucity of literature regarding comparative {EUS} characteristics of various malignant pancreatic neoplasms (primary and metastatic).
{OBJECTIVE:} To compare and characterize primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma versus other malignant neoplasms, hereafter referred to as nonprimary pancreatic adenocarcinoma ({NPPA)}, diagnosed by {EUS-guided} {FNA.}
{METHODS:} The present study was a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database. The setting was a tertiary care, academic medical centre. Patients referred for suspected pancreatic neoplasms were evaluated. Based on {EUS-FNA} characteristics, primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma was differentiated from other malignant neoplasms. The subset of other neoplasms was defined as malignant lesions that were {'NPPAs'} (ie, predominantly solid or solid⁄cystic based on {EUS} appearance and primary malignant lesions or metastatic lesions to the pancreas). Pancreatic masses that were benign cystic lesions (pseudocyst, simple cyst, serous cystadenoma) and focal inflammatory lesions (acute, chronic and autoimmune pancreatitis) were excluded.
{RESULTS:} A total of 230 patients were evaluated using {EUS-FNA} for suspected pancreatic mass lesions. Thirty-eight patients were excluded because they were diagnosed with inflammatory lesions or had purely benign cysts. One hundred ninety-two patients had confirmed malignant pancreatic neoplasms (ie, pancreatic adenocarcinoma [n=144], {NPPA} [n=48]). When comparing adenocarcinoma with {NPPA} lesions, there was no significant difference in mean age (P=0.0675), sex (P=0.3595) or average lesion size (P=0.3801). On average, four {FNA} passes were necessary to establish a cytological diagnosis in both lesion subtypes (P=0.396). Adenocarcinomas were more likely to be located in the pancreatic head (P=0.0198), whereas masses in the tail were more likely to be {NPPAs} (P=0.0006). Adenocarcinomas were also more likely to exhibit vascular invasion ({OR} 4.37; P=0.0011), malignant lymphadenopathy (P=0.0006), pancreatic duct dilation ({OR} 2.4; P=0.022) and common bile duct dilation ({OR} 2.87; P=0.039).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Adenocarcinoma was more likely to be present in the head of the pancreas, have lymph node and vascular involvement, as well as evidence of pancreatic duct and common bile duct obstruction. Of all malignant pancreatic lesions analyzed by {EUS-FNA}, 25\% were {NPPA}, suggesting that {FNA} is crucial in establishing a diagnosis and may be helpful in preoperative planning.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} To summarize {EUS-FNA} test performance in suspected pancreatic malignancy with meta-analysis.
{METHOD:} Two reviewers searched {MEDLINE} ({PubMed} and Ovid from January 2002 to January 2012) database to identify relevant studies. The reference lists of the trials were manually searched. Included studies used histopathology or clinical and morphological ({CT} and {MRI} and {US)} follow-up as the "gold standard" and provided sufficient data to construct a diagnostic 2 × 2 table. A statistical program of Meta-Disc was used to calculate the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive {LR}, negative {LR}, {DOR}, and the {SROC} curve. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were calculated to evaluate potential sources of heterogeneity.
{RESULT:} A total of 15 studies with 1860 patients were included for the analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of {EUS-FNA} were 92 \% (95 \% {CI} = 91-93 \%, p {\textless} 0.001, I (2) = 69.6 \%) and 96 \% (95 \% {CI} = 93-98 \%, p = 0.006, I (2) = 54.9 \%), respectively. The positive {LR} and negative {LR} were 14.24 (95 \% {CI} = 7.78-26.07) and 0.09 (95 \% {CI} = 0.07-0.13), respectively. The area under the curve was 0.974. The subgroup analysis of six studies with rapid on-site evaluation ({ROSE)} showed a pooled sensitivity of 95 \% (95 \% {CI} = 93-96 \%), with p value equal 0.622 and I (2) = 0. The sensitivity analysis of ten high-quality studies (a score of ≥4) showed a pooled sensitivity of 94 \% (95 \% {CI} = 93-96 \%, p = 0.144, I (2) = 33.1 \%), and the pooled specificity was 0.95 (95 \% {CI}, 0.91-0.97).
{CONCLUSION:} {EUS-FNA} had overall excellent specificity and sensitivity in accurately diagnosing solid pancreatic masses. {ROSE} could help to improve the accuracy of diagnostic test.},

	doi = {10.5858/arpa.2011-0218-OA},
	abstract = {{CONTEXT:} Little has been reported on changes in pancreatic pathology practice after implementation of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA).}
{OBJECTIVES:} We assessed the impact of {EUS-FNA} on cytologic diagnosis replacing histologic diagnosis for pancreatic disease and determined whether it fulfills Christensen criteria of a disruptive innovation effect.
{DESIGN:} Pattern of utilization during 20 years, diagnostic categories, and diagnostic accuracy of pancreatic cytology were compared before and after implementation of {EUS-FNA.} The disruptive effect of cytology relevant to biopsy was assessed by comparing the utilization trends and the accuracy of diagnosis over time.
{RESULTS:} The mean annual volume (standard deviation) of cytologic specimens increased from 24 (11) to 231 (10) after implementation of {EUS-FNA}, and that of histologic specimens increased from 97 (42) to 377 (148). The average percentage of annual cases managed by following cytology alone was 19\% (10) before versus 51\% (8) after implementation. The percentage managed by histology alone was 56\% before versus 23\% after implementation. Non-endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology decreased from 36\% to 1\%. Needle biopsies decreased from 7\% to 1\%, and other biopsy types from 29\% to 9\%. Unsatisfactory (7\% versus 1\%), atypical (16\% versus 4\%), and suspicious (16\% versus 3\%) diagnoses were significantly reduced. The accuracy of cytologic diagnosis significantly improved: the sensitivity (confidence interval) and specificity (confidence interval) for cancer diagnosis were 55\% (38\%-70\%) and 78\% (58\%-89\%) before versus 88\% (84\%-91\%) and 96\% (93\%-98\%) after implementation, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration improved the accuracy of cytologic diagnosis, reduced the number of indeterminate diagnoses, and replaced the need for tissue biopsy. Given its cost and simplicity as compared with tissue biopsy, this trend represents a disruptive innovation effect.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND/AIM:} The presence of on-site cytopathologists improves the diagnostic yield of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} of pancreatic masses; however, on-site cytopathologists are not available to all endoscopic units. We hypothesized that experienced cytotechnicians can accurately assess whether an on-site pancreatic mass fine needle aspiration specimen is adequate. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of formal cytotechnician training on the diagnostic accuracy of {EUS-FNA} of pancreatic masses.
{METHODS:} Single-centre, prospective study. The cytotechnician made an on-site assessment of specimen adequacy with immediate evaluation of smears over a 12-month period (pre-training period) then over another 12-month period (post-training period), with a year's intermediate training when the cytopathologist and the cytotechnician worked together in the room. The gold standard used to establish the final diagnosis was based on a non-equivocal fine needle aspiration biopsy reviewed by the same expert cytopathologist. The main outcome measurements were the cytotechnician diagnostic accuracy before and after the training period.
{RESULTS:} A total of 107 patients were enrolled in the pre-training period. Cytotechnician in-room adequacy was 68.2\% (73/107). The diagnostic accuracy was 74.8\%. The adequacy for the blind-review pathologist was 93.4\% (100/107), significantly higher (p=0.008) than the cytotechnician's results. During the post-training period, 95 {EUS-FNA} were performed and reviewed. Cytotechnician in-room adequacy was 87.4\% (83/95). The diagnostic accuracy was 90.5\%. The adequacy for the blinded pathologist was 95.8\% (91/95), not significantly different from the cytotechnician (p=0.23).
{CONCLUSIONS:} An adequate training period with an expert pathologist significantly improves the cytotechnician skill in terms of judging adequacy and diagnostic accuracy.},

{STUDY} {DESIGN:} Fifty-eight patients were prospectively enrolled between July and December 2009. Aspirates obtained from the first needle pass were randomized either to {SMEAR} or {LBC.} Another sample from the second needle pass was allocated to the other method. The rest of the aspirates from the third or later needle passes were used for {SMEAR.} Diagnostic accuracy was compared and related factors were pursued.
{RESULTS:} Although both methods were 100\% specific, {LBC} was inferior to {SMEAR} in terms of sensitivity, negative predictive value, and accuracy. However, {LBC} provided correct diagnoses in 2 out of 3 cases of false negatives for malignancy by {SMEAR} in which blood was highly contaminated. Although no factor was identified for {LBC}, low blood contamination and more than 3 needle passes were related with accurate diagnosis in {SMEAR.}
{CONCLUSION:} {LBC} was less accurate than {SMEAR} when performing pancreatic {EUS-FNA} without an on-site cytopathologist. However, {LBC} might serve as a good complement to {SMEAR} if blood contamination is profound.},

Few reports have described endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} and {EUS-guided} fine-needle aspiration ({FNA)} findings. Herein, we try to describe the {EUS} and {EUS-FNA} characteristics of {MP.}
{METHODS:} This retrospective study compared 28 patients with {MP} (13 males; mean age: 60.1 ± 12.6 years) and 60 control patients (30 males; 62.7 ± 11.5 years) with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ({PDAC).} All lesions were characterized by {EUS}, and {MP} was diagnosed by {EUS-FNA} (n = 16), surgery (n = 6) or both (n = 6).
{RESULTS:} Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the presence of regular borders (p = 0.004; {OR:} 8.81, 95\% {CI:} 1.97-39.4), the absence of retention cysts (p = 0.045; {OR:} 12.5, 95\% {CI:} 1.06-147.0), and the absence of main pancreatic duct ({MPD)} dilation (p = 0.003; {OR:} 8.18, 95\% {CI:} 2.04-32.8) were predictors of {MP} rather than {PDAC.} The {EUS-FNA} sampling adequacy was 95.4\% (21/22), and the correct diagnosis was obtained in 95.2\% (20/21) of cases when K-ras mutation analysis and/or immunostaining were added.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:} Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy ({EUS-FNAB)} is a useful tool in the diagnosis of pancreatic masses. Genetic analysis of these samples could increase the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis. This study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of a novel method for the detection of mutations in the {KRAS} (Kirsten rat sarcoma-2 virus) gene for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} {EUS-FNABs} were performed on 82 patients with pancreatic masses, including 54 cases of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and 28 of non-malignant pancreatic masses. The biopsies were histopathologically and cytopathologically evaluated, and the detection of {KRAS} gene mutations (codons 12 and 13) was performed through peptide nucleic acid-directed polymerase chain reaction clamping and {DNA} sequencing.
{RESULTS:} In the pancreatic cancer cases, 88.9\% (48/54; 95\% confidence interval ({CI):} 80.5-97.2\%) had {KRAS} mutations, while 61.1\% (33/54; 95\% {CI:} 48.1-74.1\%) were unequivocally diagnosed by histo/cytopathology. In the indeterminate patients (n=49; diagnosed by {EUS-FNA} as either insufficient material to make a diagnosis, no malignancy, or suspicion of malignancy), there were 10 cases of pancreatic cancer with low serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 ({CA19-9)} ({\textless}37 U/l) and 6 of these were {KRAS} mutations. The sensitivity of detection by {KRAS} mutations (76.2\%) and the combination of {KRAS} mutations and serum {CA19-9} (81\%) were significantly higher than for serum {CA19-9} alone (52.4\%). A logistic regression model showed that the {KRAS} mutation was significant (odds ratio=5.830; {CI:} 1.531-22.199, P=0.01), but not serum {CA19-9.} In the non-malignant pancreatic masses (n=28), {KRAS} mutations were detected in nine precancerous lesions.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Our method for the detection of {KRAS} gene mutations may be useful to supplement histo/cytopathologic evaluations for pancreatic cancer, and is superior to serum {CA19-9} in {EUS-FNAB} histo/cytopathology-indeterminate patients. Results warrant further verification in other patient populations.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The currently accepted paradigm is that the false-positive ({FP)} rate for {EUS-guided} fine-needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} cytologic analysis of a pancreatic lesion is less than 1\%.
{OBJECTIVE:} To assess the {FP} rate of {EUS-FNA} in patients who underwent surgical resection for presumed pancreatic cancer.
{DESIGN:} Retrospective study.
{SETTING:} Tertiary-care referral center.
{PATIENTS:} This study involved 367 patients with solid pancreatic lesions in whom {EUS-FNA} cytology results were interpreted as positive or suspicious for malignancy, which resulted in subsequent surgical resection.
{INTERVENTION:} Surgical resection.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} The {FP} diagnosis was defined as {EUS-FNA} cytology specimens being reported as "positive" or "suspicious for malignancy" but that were later proven to be benign on surgical pathology.
{RESULTS:} The {FP} rate for {EUS-FNA} was 4 of 367 (1.1\%) when only "positive" cytology findings were interpreted as malignant and 14 of 367 (3.8\%) when both suspicious and positive cytology findings were interpreted as malignant. Among the 4 cases falsely interpreted as positive, 1 was falsely diagnosed cytologically as a neuroendocrine tumor and 3 as adenocarcinomas. All {FP} specimens showed chronic pancreatitis on surgical pathology. The incidence of discordance between cytology and surgical pathology did not change over time (2000-2006: 8/188 [4.3\%] vs 2007-2010: 6/179 [3.4\%]; P = .79).
{LIMITATIONS:} Retrospective study at a single center.
{CONCLUSION:} In a retrospective cohort trial, the {FP} rate for {EUS-FNA} of solid pancreatic lesions was 1.1\%. Findings of the current study are in line with previous studies that have evaluated the {FP} cytology rates with {EUS-FNA} of solid lesions. {FP} cases transpired primarily as a result of cytologic misinterpretation in the setting of chronic pancreatitis.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} is central to discerning the diagnosis of solid pancreatic tumors through tissue acquisition. Test performance is affected by a number of factors including location of mass within the pancreas, presence of onsite cytology technologist, and number of passes with the needle. The influence of tumor size has not been well studied.
{AIM:} The objective of the current study was to determine whether the size of mass affects the diagnostic accuracy for solid pancreatic lesions aspirated under {EUS} guidance.
{METHODS:} Data were collected retrospectively on all patients with solid pancreatic masses undergoing {EUS-FNA} from June 2003 to August 2010. The cytology samples were reported as positive, suspicious for malignancy, atypical, negative, or nondiagnostic. The gold standard for a cytological diagnosis was histological confirmation or clinical follow-up of more than 6 months with repeat imaging. Patients were divided into five groups based upon lesion size as follows: (a) less than 1 cm, (b) 1-2 cm, (c) 2-3 cm, (d) 3-4 cm, and (e) greater than 4 cm. Performance characteristics of {EUS-FNA} including sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were compared for each group. Accuracy was defined as the ratio of the sum of true-positive and true-negative values divided by the number of lesions.
{RESULTS:} We identified 583 patients with solid pancreatic lesions in which {EUS-FNA} was performed and adequate cellularity was obtained (47\% men, mean age 65 ± 1.4 ({SE)} years). Overall, 486 (83\%) of lesions were pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 18 (3\%) were neuroendocrine tumors, 12 (2\%) were lymphomas, and 67 (12\%) were benign lesions. The median size of the mass was 3 cm (range, 0.5-7 cm). A mean of 4.9 passes (range, 1-9 passes) was needed to obtain adequate samples from lesions. The overall yield of obtaining adequate samples for diagnosis was 85\%. When stratified by size, the {EUS-FNA} sensitivity for lesions with size {\textless}1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, and {\textgreater}4 cm was 40, 75.9, 86.9, 93.2, and 91.6\%, respectively; {EUS-FNA} sensitivity strongly correlate with tumor size (p {\textless} 0.001). Similarly, the accuracy of {EUS-FNA} increased as lesion size increased, ranging from 47\% for tumors less than 1 cm to 88\% for tumors greater than 4 cm (p {\textless} 0.05). Location of tumor and number of needle passes did not significantly influence {EUS-FNA} performance characteristics.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of {EUS-FNA} for solid pancreatic lesions is strongly correlated with tumor size. Sensitivity and accuracy decrease significantly for tumors that are smaller than 1 cm.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Endoscopic ultrasound with fine needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} is used for the diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy. However, there are limited data as to patient preferences regarding the delivery of cancer diagnoses.
{OBJECTIVE:} This study aimed to assess if patients had met the endosonographer before their {EUS}, their suspicion of having cancer, and whether they would like the cytology results given to them by their referring physician (with whom they had a previous relationship) or the endosonographer. This question was also asked with respect to the timing of receiving cytology results.
{METHODS:} A total of 131 patients with a suspected solid pancreatic mass undergoing {EUS-FNA} at 2 tertiary referral centers were prospectively enrolled and completed a preprocedure questionnaire.
{RESULTS:} One hundred twenty patients (92\%) had not met the endosonographer before their {EUS-FNA}, and only 37 patients (28\%) thought they had a pancreatic malignancy. Of the 131 patients, 89 (68\%) stated that they wanted to hear results from the endosonographer (P = 0.0001) and 100 patients (76\%) chose to hear results as soon as possible from the endosonographer (P = 0.001).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Our data highlight the importance of the endosonographer's role in the delivery of cancer diagnoses and that patients value expediency of reporting results over long-term physician relationships.},

{METHODS:} All patients with solid pancreatic masses evaluated from September 2007 to December 2008 were enrolled and underwent {EUS-FNA} with both 22- and 25-gauge needles with randomisation of needle sequence. The accuracy of the {EUS-FNA} was determined by comparing the cytological results with the final surgical pathological diagnoses or with the results of a clinical follow-up. A cytological score with different qualitative parameters was created, and a comparison between these parameters was carried out for each needle.
{RESULTS:} Fifty patients with 50 pancreatic masses were recruited. Technical success was 100\% and no complications occurred. Diagnostic accuracy was 94\% and 86\% for the 25- and 22-gauge needles, respectively. Analysis of the cytological score showed a tendency towards the 25-gauge needle, although the difference was not statistically significant.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {EUS-FNA} performed with 22- or 25-gauge needles had the same diagnostic accuracy. Our study results confirm a significant trend towards a better cytological diagnosis for the 25-gauge needle.},

A medical literature review to evaluate the role of {EUS-FNA} for diagnosis of solid pancreatic masses showed a 78-95\% sensitivity, 75-100\% specificity, 98-100\% positive predictive value, 46-80\% negative predictive value and a 78-95\% accuracy. The reported complication rates of {EUS-FNA} for pancreatic solid masses were 0-2\%, although the criteria for complications varied among the studies. Because of its high diagnostic yield and low complication rate, {EUS-FNA} is cost-effective and widely applicable for the diagnosis of solid pancreatic masses, and is the best initial and the preferred secondary method compared with other biopsy techniques, such as endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography-guided biopsy, computed tomography/ultrasound-{FNA} and surgery. Although {EUS-FNA} is 'a nearly perfected procedure,' controversy remains, such as the most suitable diameter of the needle, the appropriate number of needle passes and the necessity of on-site cytopathological evaluation. Recently investigators reported that using molecular analysis of {EUS-FNA} samples can achieve a higher diagnostic efficacy.

{METHODS:} Patients undergoing {EUS-guided} {FNA} of solid pancreatic lesions over a 2-year study period were included. Samples were either evaluated on site by a cytopathologist or processed by the endoscopist and sent to the pathology department for evaluation. Diagnostic accuracy for malignancy, number of needle passes, adequate-specimen collection rate, cytological diagnosis, and final diagnosis, and complication rate according to the presence or absence of on-site cytopathologist were evaluated.
{RESULTS:} A total of 182 patients were included. An on-site cytopathologist was available in 95 cases (52.2\%). There was no difference between groups in terms of age, sex, location, and size of the lesions. A significantly higher number of needle passes was performed when an on-site cytopathologist was not available (3.5±1.0 vs. 2.0±0.7; P{\textless}0.001). The presence of an on-site cytopathologist was associated with a significantly lower number of inadequate samples (1.0 vs. 12.6\%, P=0.002), and a significantly higher diagnostic sensitivity (96.2 vs. 78.2\%; P=0.002) and overall accuracy (96.8 vs. 86.2\%; P=0.013) for malignancy. Three patients developed complications (two acute pancreatitis, one local bleeding), all of them belonging to the group without on-site cytopathology.

In this study, we elaborate on our experience of specimen adequacy criteria, overall efficiency of the technique, and the cytomorphologic features of various pancreatic lesions.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} {EUS-FNA} of the pancreas and subsequent surgical and/or clinical follow-up of all cases performed at King Khalid University Hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from November 2006 to January 2010, were retrospectively reviewed. Diff-Quik and Papanicolaou staining methods were used. Immunohistochemistry stains on cell-block preparations were applied whenever available and required. A total of 43 aspirates from 42 patients were available for retrospective review, including 37 (86\%) adequate/diagnostic and 6 (14\%) inadequate/non-diagnostic cases.

Our aim was to develop a prediction rule to stratify risk for pancreatic cancer in chronic pancreatitis patients with focal pancreatic mass lesions with prior negative {EUS-FNA} cytology.
{MATERIAL} {AND} {METHODS:} A total of 138 eligible consecutive patients were identified from three hospitals between January 2000 and May 2008. A final diagnosis of pancreatic mass lesions was confirmed histologically or verified by a follow-up of at least 12 months. A prediction rule was developed from a logistic regression model by using a regression coefficient-based scoring method, and then internally validated by using bootstrapping.
{RESULTS:} The rate of pancreatic cancer in the cohort was 18.1\%. The prediction rule, which was scored from 0 to 10 points, comprised five variables: sex, mass location, mass number, direct bilirubin, and {CA} 19-9. Among the 87.7\% of patients with low-risk scores (≤ 3), the risk of pancreatic cancer was 13.2\%; by comparison, this risk was 52.9\% (p {\textless} 0.001) among the 12.3\% of patients with high-risk scores ({\textgreater} 3). If further invasive tests were used for patients with high risk, 36\% of patients with pancreatic cancer would not be missed. The prediction rule had good discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.72) and calibration (p = 0.96).
{CONCLUSIONS:} The prediction rule can provide available risk stratification for pancreatic cancer in chronic pancreatitis patients with focal mass lesions with prior negative {EUS-FNA} cytology. Application of risk stratification may improve clinical decision making.},

	doi = {10.1097/MPA.0b013e3181f66e64},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:} Our aim was to determine whether the presence of a biliary stent during endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} affects diagnosis and complication rates.
{METHODS:} Retrospective analysis was performed of 268 patients with pancreatic head or neck adenocarcinoma who underwent {EUS-FNA} at our academic medical center between 2000 and 2009. Endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography reports, cytology results, and physicians' notes were reviewed.
{RESULTS:} A total of 170 patients without stents, 87 patients with stents placed more than 1 day before {EUS}, and 11 patients with stents placed less than 1 day before {EUS} were identified. In patients without stents, the tissue diagnosis rate via {EUS-FNA} was 92.4\% compared with a rate of 88.5\% for those with stents placed more than 1 day before {EUS-FNA} (P=0.36). However, the patients with stents placed immediately before {EUS-FNA} were more likely to have indeterminate results from the {EUS-FNA} than the other patients were (P=0.008). Complication rates were the same among the groups.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Pre-{EUS} stenting of biliary obstruction due to pancreatic adenocarcinoma does not influence the rate of tissue diagnosis if performed more than 1 day before {EUS-FNA.} Lack of immediate {EUS} access should not preclude stent placement in appropriate patients with malignant biliary obstruction who will undergo {EUS-FNA.}},

	abstract = {Fine needle aspiration ({FNA)} cytology, together with imaging, has become a primary diagnostic modality for investigation of pancreatic mass lesions, both cystic and solid. Advances in imaging techniques have enhanced our ability to recognize and delineate pancreatic masses and to detect them earlier as smaller mass lesions. However, definitive management often cannot be based on clinical and radiological features alone. Despite the advances in the imaging techniques, management options for patients are limited and a malignant diagnosis of solid lesions still carries a high mortality rate. The importance of a cytopathologist in preoperative diagnosis, as a member of the multidisciplinary team, is exemplified in the management of patients with neoplastic cysts. This is based on the pre-operative distinction of non-mucinous and mucinous cysts in general, and benign and malignant cysts in particular. A cytological diagnosis can be obtained with minimally invasive techniques that utilize {CT} {US} or {EUS.} Endoscopic Ultrasound guided {FNA} ({EUS} {FNA)} is evolving as the diagnostic method of choice due to its ability to more accurately stage the patient during a single procedure using {EUS.}},

	doi = {10.1111/j.1477-2574.2010.00180.x},
	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:} The reported median diagnostic yield from endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} fine-needle aspiration ({FNA)} cytology is 78\% (range 39-93\%). The aim of this study is to describe a single-centre experience in the diagnostic work-up of solid pancreatic and peripancreatic masses without the benefit of an onsite cytopathologist.
{METHODS:} In a consecutive series of 429 {EUS} examinations performed over a 12-month period by a single operator, 108 were on non-cystic pancreatic or biliary lesions. Data were collected prospectively and the accuracy of {FNA} was assessed retrospectively using either surgery or repeat imaging as the benchmark in the presence or absence of malignancy.
{RESULTS:} Of the 108 {FNAs}, 102 (94\%) were diagnostic, four were falsely negative ({FN)} and two were atypical and considered equivocal. There were 78 pancreatic lesions, of which 65 were true positives ({TP)}, 11 true negatives ({TN)} and two {FN}, giving an overall accuracy of 97\% (76/78). Of nine periampullary lesions, two were {TP}, six were {TN} and one was {FN}, giving an overall accuracy of 89\% (8/9). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value ({PPV)}, negative predictive value ({NPV)} and accuracy of {EUS-FNA} for pancreatic and periampullary lesions combined were 96\%, 100\%, 100\% [95\% confidence interval ({CI)} 95-100\%], 85\% (95\% {CI} 62-97\%) and 97\%, respectively. There were 21 bile duct lesions, of which 10 were {TP}, eight {TN}, two atypical and one {FN}, giving an overall accuracy of 86\% (18/21). The sensitivity, specificity, {PPV}, {NPV} and accuracy of {EUS-FNA} for biliary lesions were 91\%, 100\%, 100\% (95\% {CI} 69-100\%), 91\% (95\% {CI} 59-100\%) and 95\%, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The diagnostic accuracy of {EUS-FNA} for pancreatic lesions in our series was 97\% and the {PPV} for the three subgroups of lesion type was 100\%; these figures are comparable with the best rates reported in the literature, despite the absence of onsite cytopathology. These rates are potentially a direct result of high-volume practice, dedicated endosonography and cytopathology. These results show that it is possible to achieve high rates of accuracy in places where logistical issues make it impossible to maintain a cytopathologist in the endoscopy suite. In addition, our results contribute to the limited, collective global experience on the effectiveness of {EUS-FNA} in periampullary and biliary lesions.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} This retrospective Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study was approved by the Institutional Review Board ({IRB);} informed consent ({IC)} was waived. Data of 377 patients who underwent computed tomography-guided {FNA} and {CNB} of lesions of the lung, liver, pancreas, or enlarged lymph nodes were enrolled. An onsite cytopathologist was not available. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for {FNA}, {CNB}, and combined {FNA/CNB.} For the purpose of our study, positive diagnoses from {CNB} specimens or subsequent biopsy or surgical resection specimens or clinical follow-up data were considered as the standard of reference.
{RESULTS:} {CNB} yielded a significantly higher sensitivity than {FNA} in all sites, except the pancreas, where the difference did not reach statistical significance. Additional {FNA} to {CNB} did not significantly increase the sensitivity. Specificity did not significantly differ between {FNA}, {CNB}, and combined {FNA/CNB} in all sites. Malignancies of 1.7\% were detected only with {FNA}, without evidence of malignancy in {CNB;} for the remaining malignancies, {CNB} was positive or indeterminate.

{AIM:} To determine the frequency and severity of complications after {EUS-FNA} of solid and cystic pancreatic lesions in a single centre large series of patients.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} From January 2005 to December 2008, information on all patients referred to our unit for pancreatic {EUS} was systematically entered in a computer database including clinical and morphologic data. Records were reviewed to evaluate whether complications such as haemorrhage, acute pancreatitis, intestinal perforation, or others occurred after {EUS-FNA} of the pancreas.
{RESULTS:} A total of 3296 pancreatic {EUS} were done in four years. In the 1034 pancreatic {EUS-FNA}, we observed 10 (0.96\%) haemorrhages (7 intracystic, 2 in the pancreatic duct, and 1 in a small carcinoma), 2 (0.19\%) acute severe pancreatitis and 1 (0.09\%) duodenal perforation followed by complicated post-surgical hospitalization and death. The haemorrhages were all self-limiting. Overall, major complications (pancreatitis and perforation) arose in 0.29\% of these examinations.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {EUS-FNA} is safe, with a low risk of severe haemorrhage. Although rare, acute pancreatitis is generally mild or severe, requiring prolonged hospitalization. One fatal complication occurred after duodenal perforation in a patient with duodenal neuroendocrine tumour and pancreatic infiltration.},

Mutation of {KRAS} oncogene is present in 75\% to 95\% of {PADC.} This study aimed to evaluate whether the combined analysis of {KRAS} mutation with cytopathological findings from endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy ({EUS-FNAB)} might improve discrimination between {PADC} and chronic pancreatitis.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} This prospective multicenter study included 178 patients with solid pancreatic masses (men 104, women 74; mean age 64.5 years). Cytopathological examination and {KRAS} mutation analysis (codon-12 and codon-13, restriction fragment length polymorphism [{RFLP]} and direct sequencing) were performed on {EUS-FNAB} material. Final diagnoses were obtained on {EUS-FNAB} analysis and/or a second biopsy and/or clinical follow-up and/or surgery: {PADC}, n = 129; chronic pancreatitis, n = 27; other pancreatic neoplasms, n = 16; and benign lesions, n = 6.
{RESULTS:} {KRAS} status analysis was successful in all {EUS-FNAB} samples. Codon-12 {KRAS} point mutation was found in 66\% of {PADC} samples. No case of chronic pancreatitis displayed {KRAS} mutation. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and overall accuracy of cytopathology alone for diagnosis of {PADC} versus chronic pancreatitis were 83\%, 100\%, 100\%, 56\% and 86\%, respectively. When {KRAS} mutation analysis was combined with cytopathology, these values reached 88\%, 100\%, 100\%, 63\% and 90\% respectively.
{CONCLUSION:} Although the value of {KRAS} analysis in addition to {EUS-FNAB} is limited for distinguishing pancreatic mass lesions, when chronic pancreatitis presented as a pseudotumor a negative finding (wild-type {KRAS)}, was useful in strongly suggesting a benign lesion.},

{OBJECTIVES:} Determine the safety, accuracy and clinical utility of {EUS-FNA} for T, N and {TN} staging and vascular injury assessment in proven ductal pancreatic carcinoma.
{PATIENTS:} Fifty-two consecutive patients (29 women and 23 men) with histologically ductal pancreatic carcinoma, with an excellent possibility of mass resection assessed by helical computerized tomography, were studied. Mean age was 62.4 years (range: 27-82 years). Tumor locations were in the head (43 cases), body (5 cases) and tail (4 cases) of the pancreas. Mean tumor size from {EUS} was 3.7 cm (range: 0.8-6.2 cm).
{METHODS:} We reviewed medical records and abdominal ultrasound, {CT}, {EUS-FNA} and the results were compared to surgical and histological findings.
{RESULTS:} Ultrasound identified pancreatic abnormalities in 38 out of 52 patients (73.1\%): pancreatic mass (25 cases), pancreatic head enlargement (8 cases), dilation of main pancreatic duct (3 cases), pancreatic cyst (1 case) and pancreatic calcification (1 case). {CT} showed a pancreatic mass (30 cases), pancreatic enlargement (17 cases), pancreatic cystic lesion (2 cases) and pancreatic calcification (1 case) in 50 out of 52 patients (96.2\%). {EUS-FNA} found a clear pancreatic tumor image in all patients (100\%).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {STUDY} {AIMS:} Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} is now performed routinely in many advanced endoscopy centers and has enhanced the ability to diagnose pancreatic masses. However, there is uncertainty about which needle size is optimal for {EUS-FNA} of pancreatic masses. We aimed to evaluate the performance of the 22-gauge and 25-gauge needles in obtaining cytologic diagnosis of pancreatic masses.
{METHODS:} All cases that were referred for {EUS-FNA} for pancreatic masses between February 2001 and June 2007 were reviewed, and patients who underwent {EUS-FNA} using the 22-gauge and 25-gauge needle system were identified. In patients who underwent surgery, operative histopathological findings were compared with the cytopathological findings from {EUS-FNA.}
{RESULTS:} A total of 842 patients with pancreatic masses detected on computed tomography ({CT)} and/or magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} and confirmed by {EUS} underwent {EUS-FNA} with the 22-gauge needle (n = 540) or the 25-gauge needle (n = 302). Results of {EUS-FNA} cytology findings were compared with the gold standard of surgical histopathological findings or long-term clinical follow-up. The sensitivity, specificity, {PPV}, and {NPV} of {FNA} were respectively 84\%, 100\%, 100\%, and 73\% [corrected] for the 22-gauge needle compared with 92\%, 97\%, 98\%, and 87\%, [corrected] respectively for the 25-gauge needle. No complications were noted in the 25-gauge needle group, compared with pancreatitis in 2\% of the 22-gauge needle group.
{CONCLUSIONS:} This retrospective comparative study shows that {EUS-FNA} with a 25-gauge needle system is a safe and reliable method for tissue sampling in pancreatic masses. The system is more sensitive and has a slightly [corrected] higher {NPV} than the standard 22-gauge needle. Our study suggests that perhaps the smaller caliber {FNA} needle causes less trauma during {EUS-FNA} and hence less complications. Further studies including randomized trials are needed.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} with fine-needle aspiration ({FNA)} can characterize and diagnose pancreatic lesions as malignant, but cannot definitively rule out the presence of malignancy. Outcome data regarding the length of follow-up in patients with negative or nondiagnostic {EUS-FNA} of pancreatic lesions are not well-established.
{OBJECTIVE:} To determine the long-term outcome and provide follow-up guidance for patients with negative {EUS-FNA} diagnosis of suspected pancreatic lesions based on imaging predictors.
{METHODS:} A retrospective review of patients undergoing {EUS-FNA} for suspected pancreatic lesions, but with negative or nondiagnostic {FNA} results was conducted at a tertiary care referral medical centre. Patient demographics, {EUS} imaging characteristics and follow-up data were examined.
{RESULTS:} Seventeen of 55 patients (30.9\%) with negative/nondiagnostic {FNA} were subsequently diagnosed with pancreatic malignancy. The risk of cancer was significantly higher for patients who had associated lymph nodes on {EUS} (P{\textless}0.001) and vascular involvement on {EUS} (P=0.001). The mean time to diagnosis in the group with falsenegative {EUS-FNA} diagnosis was 66 days. The true-negative {EUSFNA} patients were followed for a mean of 403 days after negative {EUS-FNA} results without the development of malignancy.
{CONCLUSION:} For patients undergoing {EUS-FNA} for a suspected pancreatic lesion, a negative or nondiagnostic {FNA} does not provide conclusive evidence for the absence of cancer. Patients for whom vascular invasion and lymphadenopathy are detected on {EUS} are more likely to have a true malignant lesion and should be followed closely.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} with rapid on-site evaluation ({ROSE)} has been reported to provide a more accurate diagnosis than {EUS-FNA} without such evaluation. However, even endosonographers can evaluate {ROSE} regarding sample adequacy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of {EUS-FNA} with {ROSE} by endosonographers compared to {ROSE} by cytopathologists in patients with solid pancreatic masses.
{METHODS:} Between September 2001 and October 2005, of the 73 {EUS-FNA} procedures with the final diagnoses, 38 procedures after the introduction of {ROSE} by endosonographers (September 2001-September 2003, period 1), and 35 procedures after the introduction of {ROSE} by cytopathologists (October 2003-October 2005, period 2) were included. The specimens were stained with Diff-Quik stain and assessed. When the on-site assessors (endosonographers or cytopathologists) indicated that the amounts of cell samples were adequate, the procedure was stopped.
{RESULTS:} Results are presented with 95\% confidence limits. The average numbers of needle passes were 4.0 +/- 1.6 and 3.4 +/- 1.5 in periods 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.06). The specimen collection rates were 97.4 and 97.1\% in periods 1 and 2, respectively (P = 0.51). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for malignancy and benign were 92.9, 100, 100, 83.3, and 94.7\%, respectively, in period 1, and 93.1, 100, 100, 75.0, and 94.3\%, respectively, in period 2 (P = 0.97, P = 1.0, P = 1.0, P = 0.65, P = 0.93, respectively). No complications were seen.
{CONCLUSIONS:} For accurate diagnosis, {ROSE} should be performed during {EUS-FNA} by the endosonographer, if no cytopathologist is available.},

We describe the performance and pitfalls of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} for diagnosis of these rare pancreatic tumors and their characteristic cytopathological features.
{METHODS:} The records of 455 pancreatic fine-needle aspiration procedures done between March 1997 and August 2006 at Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan, were reviewed. Besides cytology, aspirated material was routinely submitted in formalin for cell-block analysis. The reference standard for final diagnosis was surgical pathology from resected specimens.
{RESULTS:} Twenty-eight rare (nonductal adenocarcinomas) pancreatic tumors were identified. Overall, {EUS-FNA} with the results of cytology, cell-block processing, and immunohistochemistry could correctly diagnose the type of neoplasm in 19 (67.9\%) cases. {EUS-FNA} could distinguish benign from malignant rare tumors with a sensitivity of 69.2\%, a specificity of 100\%, positive predictive value of 100\%, negative predictive value of 79.0\%, and accuracy of 85.7\%. None of three malignant pancreatic endocrine neoplasms could be diagnosed as malignant. An adequate core tissue sample could be obtained in 21 cases (75.0\%) and provide a histopathological diagnosis in 19 (67.9\%) cases. {EUS-FNA} could change the presumptive diagnosis in 11 (39.3\%) cases. Specific immunochemical studies were useful adjuncts to the diagnosis. No major or minor complication was noted in any patient.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Pancreatic neoplasms other than ductal adenocarcinomas have diverse imaging and histopathological features. {EUS-FNA} is accurate and safe for their identification.},

{METHODS:} We prospectively reviewed data on 100 consecutive {EUS-FNA} procedures performed in 93 patients (54 men, mean age 60.6 +/- 12.9 years) for evaluation of solid pancreatic lesions. Final diagnosis was based on a composite standard: histologic evidence at surgery, or non-equivocal malignant cytology on {FNA} and follow-up. The operating characteristics of {EUS-FNA} were determined.
{RESULTS:} The location of the lesions was pancreatic head in 73\% of cases, the body in 20\% and the tail in 7\%. Mean lesion size was 35.1 +/- 12.9 mm. The final diagnosis revealed malignancy in 87 cases, including adenocarcinomas (80.5\%), neuroendocrine tumours (11.5\%), lymphomas (3.4\%) and other types (4.6\%). The {FNA} findings were: 82\% interpreted as malignant cytology, 1\% as suspicious for neoplasia, 1\% as atypical, 7\% as benign process and 9\% as non-diagnostic. No false-positive results were observed. There was a false-negative rate of 5\%. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy were 94.3\%, 100\%, 100\%, 72.2\% and 95\%, respectively. In 23 (88.5\%) of 26 aspirated lymph nodes malignancy was found. Minor complications occurred in two patients.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Our experience confirms that {EUS-FNA} in patients with suspected solid pancreatic lesions is safe and has a high diagnostic accuracy. This technique should be considered the preferred test when a cytological diagnosis of a pancreatic mass lesion is required.},

	abstract = {{INTRODUCTION:} Despite advances in imaging techniques, the differentiation between pancreatic cancer and benign lesions remains difficult. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} is an effective method for providing tissue diagnosis, but problems occur when lesions are small or the cytological diagnosis is indeterminate.
{AIM:} To prospectively evaluate the utility of {EUS-FNA} in patients with small solid pancreatic lesions and those with initial indeterminate or negative cytological diagnosis.
{METHODS:} During the study period we performed a total of 119 {EUS-FNA} procedures on 46 patients (mean age 56.3 years) for 47 small solid pancreatic lesions (range 7-30 mm, mean 17.2 mm in diameter). {FNAs} were performed in the presence of a cytopathologist. If cytological diagnoses were indeterminate, {EUS-FNA} was repeated within 3 weeks. Diagnoses were confirmed histologically or by follow-up (clinical and imaging: {EUS} +/- {FNA} and {CT).}
{RESULTS:} Localization of the lesions: head 28 (60\%), uncinate process 4 (9\%), body 11 (23\%) and tail 4 (9\%). On average, 3.7 passes were performed. We observed no complications. Initial cytological findings were: malignant 17 (36\%), benign 21 (45\%), and indeterminate 9 (19\%). 8 (78\%) of the indeterminate findings were confirmed to be malignant on repeated procedures. A diagnosis of pancreatic cancer was subsequently confirmed in 1 patient who had a benign cytological finding. 19 patients underwent surgery. Histology confirmed a neoplasm in all cases. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy were 68, 100, 100, 73 and 83\%, respectively. After repeated {EUS-FNAs} of indeterminate findings sensitivity, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy rose to 92, 77 and 96\%, respectively.
{CONCLUSION:} {EUS-FNA} is a highly effective method for providing tissue diagnosis in patients with small solid pancreatic masses. Repeated procedures enhanced diagnostic accuracy in indeterminate findings, among which was high percentage of malignancies. {EUS-FNA} reduced the number of operations in patients with pancreatic solid masses.},

	abstract = {Cytological smear is widely employed to analyse specimens obtained from endosonography-guided fine-needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)}, but false-negative or inconclusive results may occur. A better diagnostic yield can be obtained from processing cell blocks. We compared the effectiveness of the cell block technique and cytological smear in the diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasms. From January 1997 to December 2006, 611 patients with pancreatic tumors were evaluated by {EUS-FNA.} Surgery was performed in 356 cases, and the other 255 patients were followed clinically for an average of 12.8 months. In total, 282 (46.2\%) patients were evaluated with cytological smears, and 329 (53.8\%) were evaluated using only cell blocks. Malignant disease was detected in 352 (57.6\%) cases, in which adenocarcinoma accounted for 236 (67\%) cases. A benign disease was found in the other 259 cases, including 35.1\% focal chronic pancreatitis and 32.4\% pseudocysts. Aspiration samples were satisfactory in 595 (97.4\%) patients after an average of 2.2 (1-4) passes of the needle. Regardless of the cytopathological examination technique, {EUS-FNA} confirmed malignancy in 269 of 352 (76.4\%) cases, and a benign disease in 257 of 259 (99.2\%) cases. For patients who received surgery with histologically confirmed lesions, the sensitivity specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of the smears versus cell blocks in diagnosing pancreatic tumors were 61\% versus 85.2\% (P{\textless}0.001), 100\% versus 93.1\%, 100\% versus 98.4\%, 36\% versus 55.1\% (P=0.046) and 68\% versus 86.5\% (P{\textless}0.001), respectively The cell block technique demonstrated a hig her sensitivity, negative predictive value and accuracy than cytological smears.},

{STUDY} {DESIGN:} Retrospective 5-year (2001-2006) audit of all pancreatic {FNA} samples.
{RESULTS:} This series includes 267 patients (88 men, 179 women). Seven cases (2.6\%) yielded insufficient material for diagnosis; 260 cases were classified as benign (n=118) and malignant (n=142) lesions. Of the 118 benign aspirates, the cytodiagnosis was acute/chronic inflammation in 24, tuberculosis in 1, benign cyst in 10 and a benign aspirate, not otherwise specified, in the remaining 83 cases. Of the 142 malignant aspirates, the cytodiagnosis was adenocarcinoma in 126, neuroendocrine/carcinoid tumor in 7, papillary solid epithelial neoplasm in 2, mucinous cystadenocarcinoma in 2, acinar cell carcinoma in 1 and metastatic small cell carcinoma in lung in 4 cases. Cytohistologic correlation yielded a sensitivity of 81\% and specificity of 100\%.

{METHODS:} Fifty-three patients with focal pancreatic lesions underwent {EUS-FNA} from March 2005 to March 2006. The final diagnosis was confirmed by the histological analysis from the surgical specimen and/or clinical follow-up for at least 6 months.
{RESULTS:} . Fifty-two patients were evaluated. Forty-seven useful samples for histological evaluation were obtained. Adequate samples were obtained in 83.3\% (5/6) for lesions {\textless} 20 mm, 100\% (19/19) for lesions from 20 to {\textless} 40 mm and 85.1\% (23/ 27) for those {\textgreater} or = 40 mm.

Our aims were to determine the yield and success of repeat {EUS-FNA} and the reasons for failure of initial {EUS-FNA.}
{METHODS:} This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in a tertiary University based referral center for pancreatico-biliary disorders. All patients who underwent more then one {EUS-FNA} for evaluation of suspected pancreatic cancer over a five and a half year period were included in this analysis.
{RESULTS:} Of the 547 procedures performed on 517 patients, 24 (4.6\%) patients underwent 51 repeat {EUS-FNA} procedures. Initial {EUS-FNA} was atypical/suspicious in 10 (41.6\%), benign in 10 (41.6\%), malignant in two (8.3\%), and failed/indeterminate in two (8.3\%) patients. Eight of 10 (80\%) patients with atypical/suspicious findings at initial {EUS-FNA} were diagnosed with malignancy on repeat {EUS-FNA.} Of the 10 patients with benign findings at initial {EUS-FNA}, repeat study diagnosed two (20\%) with malignancy and the rest were confirmed benign on long-term follow up (average 530 days, {SD} 369 days). Of the two patients with indeterminate findings at initial {EUS-FNA}, repeat study diagnosed one patient with malignant disease and the other with benign disease that was confirmed by long-term follow up. Of the two patients diagnosed with neoplastic disease at initial {EUS-FNA}, repeat {EUS-FNA} with immunostains downgraded both to chronic pancreatitis. Repeat {EUS-FNA} facilitated determination of the true status of disease in 20 of 24 patients (accuracy 84\%). Suspected reasons for failed initial {EUS-FNA} were: coexisting pancreatitis (n = 10; 42\%), technical difficulty due to scope positioning in uncinate lesion/sedation failure (n = 4; 16.7\%), difficult cytology (partly cystic, extensive necrosis, well-differentiated adenocarcinoma) (n = 4; 16.7\%), presence of ascites or collaterals (n = 3; 12.5\%), pathologist's interobserver variation (n = 2; 8.33\%), and unknown reason in one patient.

	abstract = {In the era of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)}, a minimally invasive, safe, and accurate cytologic examination of a variety of intra-abdominal neoplasms has become possible. To assess the efficacy of {EUS-FNA} for diagnosis of primary pancreatic tumors, a 10-year retrospective review of a consecutive series of patients diagnosed between 1996 and 2005 was undertaken. Comparisons were made between early (1996-2000) and late (2001-2005) periods regarding diagnostic modalities used and the concordance of {EUS-FNA} cytology with macroscopic tissue histology. Although macroscopic biopsy diagnostic yield did not change over time, yield from {EUS-FNA} increased from 40 per cent to 95 per cent (P = 0.001). Because of improved accuracy of {FNA} cytology, only six per cent of tumors required additional macroscopic tissue histology in the late period versus 35 per cent in the early period (P = 0.001). There was 100 per cent concordance between the cytologic and histologic diagnoses in the late period versus only 33 per cent in the early period (P = 0.032). We conclude that (1) the frequency of pathologically diagnosed pancreatic tumors doubled over 10 years, (2) utilization of {EUS-FNA} significantly increased the accuracy of cytologic diagnosis, and (3) as a result, the need for macroscopic tissue biopsy for diagnosis of pancreatic neoplasms has been obviated.},

{OBJECTIVE:} To evaluate the role of endoscopic ultrasound and fine needle aspiration in differentiating between inflammatory masses and malignancies in chronic pancreatitis.
{DESIGN:} Retrospective study.
{SETTING:} Tertiary care endoscopy unit.
{PATIENTS} {AND} {INTERVENTIONS:} Between February 1997 and December 2006, 69 pancreatic head masses from patients with alcoholic chronic pancreatitis underwent {EUS-FNA} using a linear echoendoscope and 22-gauge needles. Final diagnoses were obtained from surgery or clinical follow-up. The patients were subdivided into two groups: pseudotumoral chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer.
{RESULTS:} Pseudotumoral masses and adenocarcinoma were found in 58 and 11 patients, respectively. The size of the lesions and the clinical presentation were similar in both groups, but the cancer patients were older than the patients with pseudotumoral masses (P=0.020). Fourteen of the 58 (24.1\%) pseudotumoral masses were misdiagnosed as cancers, and 4 of the 11 (36.4\%) cancers were erroneously diagnosed as pseudotumoral masses when evaluated by {EUS} alone. {EUS-FNA} confirmed the final diagnosis in 66 of the 69 (95.7\%) cases. Cytopathology correctly classified 8 of the 11 (72.7\%) malignancies and all benign cases. Three of the 11 (27.3\%) cancers were misdiagnosed as pseudotumoral masses, and no pseudotumoral mass was diagnosed as a cancer. In two cases, the specimens were inadequate for cytopathological assessment. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the diagnostic accuracy of {EUS-FNA} were 72.7\%, 100\%, 100\%, 95.1\% and 95.7\%, respectively.

{AIMS:} To prospectively evaluate feasibility, effectiveness and safety of endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration of pancreatic masses in a consecutive study of unselected patients.
{METHODS:} Two hundred ninety-three patients were enrolled in two referral Hospitals in Northern Italy. All patients were referred either due to the presence of imaging test abnormalities (suspected or evident masses, or features indirectly suggesting the presence of a mass) or due to clinical or biochemical findings suggesting pancreatic cancer in the absence of positive imaging. All patients underwent linear array endoscopic ultrasound and, when indicated, fine needle aspiration. All procedures were recorded prospectively. The final diagnosis was established at the end of follow-up or when the patients underwent surgery or died.
{RESULTS:} Fine needle aspiration was indicated in 246 of 293 cases (84\%), considered technically feasible in 232 of 246 cases (94\%) and gave adequate samples for histopathological diagnosis in 204 of 232 cases (88\%).

There was good agreement with final diagnosis for endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration (kappa 0.673, {95\%CI} 0.592-0.753), greater than that for endoscopic ultrasound alone (kappa 0.515, {95\%CI} 0.425-0.605). There was one case of intracystic haemorrhage and one case of transient hyperthermia (0.3\%).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Endoscopic ultrasound-fine needle aspiration of pancreatic masses seems to be feasible, effective and safe in this consecutive study of patients.},

	abstract = {{AIM:} To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} for pancreatic solid tumors larger or smaller than 3 cm, and cystic lesions.
{METHODS:} From January/1997 to December/2006, 611 patients with pancreatic tumors were subjected to {EUS-FNA.} The final diagnosis was obtained either by surgery (356 cases) or after a mean clinical follow-up of 11.8 mo in the remaining patients.
{RESULTS:} There were 405 solid tumors, 189 cystic lesions and 17 mixed. Pancreatic specimens for cytological assessment were successfully obtained by {EUS-FNA} in 595 (97.4\%) cases. There were 352 (57.6\%) malignancies and 259 (42.4\%) benign tumors. Among the malignancies, pancreatic adenocarcinomas accounted for 67\% of the lesions. Overall, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of {EUS-FNA} were, respectively, 78.4\%, 99.2\%, 99.3\%, 77.2\% and 87.2\%. Specifically for solid tumors, the same parameters for neoplasms larger and smaller than 3 cm were, respectively, 78.8\% vs 82.4\%, 100\% vs 98.4\%, 100\% vs 99\%, 54.8\% vs 74.1\% and 83.1\% vs 87.8\%. For cystic lesions, the values were, respectively, 72.2\%, 99.3\%, 97.5\%, 91\% and 92.2\%.
{CONCLUSION:} {EUS-FNA} can be used to sample pancreatic tumors in most patients. Even though the negative predictive value is inadequate for large solid tumors, the results are rather good for small solid tumors, especially concerning the sensitivity, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy. Among all pancreatic lesions, {EUS-FNA} for cystic lesions can reveal the best negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy, both higher than 90\%.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {AND} {AIM:} For reduction in cost, time and risk of complications, the number of endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)-guided} fine-needle aspiration ({FNA)} passes should be minimized. Previous studies have shown that tumor differentiation and site of aspiration will affect the number of passes in patients with pancreatic cancer. There have been no reports that {EUS} features of pancreatic malignancies per se will influence the number of passes. Our aim was to prospectively assess various factors that would affect the number of passes in patients with pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} Between May 2003 and December 2004, 41 patients with presumed pancreatic cancer were studied. {EUS-guided} {FNA} was performed with an Olympus {GF-UC2000P} echoendoscope and a 22-gauge needle. On-site assessment of the specimen by a cytopathologist was available during the procedure.
{RESULTS:} Adenocarcinomas were confirmed in 25 patients. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas with intratumoral anechoic foci required a higher number of diagnostic passes than those without anechoic change (3.40 vs 2.27, P {\textless} 0.05). An average of 4.00 {FNA} passes for diagnosing a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma was also significantly higher than the 2.40 diagnostic passes for a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and the 2.00 passes for a poorly differentiated one (P {\textless} 0.05).
{CONCLUSIONS:} The existence of intratumoral anechoic foci was not a rare finding under detailed {EUS} investigation of pancreatic cancer. Both the existence of intratumoral anechoic foci and the differentiation of the cancer are significant predictive factors for the number of diagnostic {EUS-FNA} passes.},

{RESULTS:} The overall diagnostic rate, sensitivity, and {NPV} of fine-needle aspiration biopsies guided using {CT} (97.7\%, 94.9\%, and 60\%, respectively) were not significantly different from those guided using endoscopic sonography (88.9\%, 85\%, and 57.1\%, respectively).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Telomerase activity is up-regulated in pancreatic cancer. Hence, measurement of telomerase activity in pancreatic needle-biopsy specimens could assist in establishing a positive diagnosis in specimens that are inadequate for cytology.
{OBJECTIVE:} To determine the sensitivity and specificity of telomerase activity for neoplasia in a series of {EUS-guided} fine-needle aspirate ({EUS-FNA)} biopsies of pancreatic mass lesions.
{DESIGN:} Prospective, consecutive, non-randomized cohort.
{SETTING:} Academic hospital, tertiary referral center.
{PATIENTS:} Seventy-one patients with a pancreatic mass diagnosed by cross-sectional imaging.
{INTERVENTIONS:} {EUS-FNA} of 52 solid and 18 cystic pancreatic lesions.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} (1) Cytologic diagnosis; (2) tissue telomerase activity by semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction; (3) patient demographics; (4) clinical outcomes.
{RESULTS:} Cytology results were positive for adenocarcinoma in 40 patients with a solid pancreatic mass; of these, telomerase activity was detected in 31. There were no telomerase false-positive results. Telomerase results were positive in 6 of the 7 patients (86\%) who had negative cytology results and who eventually were found to have biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma. The sensitivity and specificity of telomerase activity for detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma in solid masses was 79\% (95\% {CI}, 64\%-89\%) and 100\% (95\% {CI}, 55\%-100\%).
{LIMITATIONS:} Extremely high sensitivity and specificity of {EUS-FNA} cytology in solid lesions minimized the incremental benefit of telomerase.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Telomerase activity can be measured readily in specimens obtained at {EUS-FNA} and accurately predicts malignancy. Used in combination with cytology, telomerase increased the sensitivity from 85\% to 98\% while maintaining the specificity at 100\%. Lesions with negative cytology result and positive telomerase activity should be evaluated aggressively to exclude malignancy.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration ({EUS-FNA)} can now provide a cytopathological diagnosis of underlying pancreatic malignancy with higher success rates than endoscopic retrograde pancreatography ({ERP).} To determine the significance of {EUS-FNA} for the diagnosis of pancreatic mass without biliary stricture, the value of cytopathological diagnosis obtained by {EUS-FNA} was retrospectively compared with that by {ERP}, and the complications associated with these procedures evaluated.
{METHODS:} Eighty-three patients who were suspected to have a pancreatic mass (excluding a cystic mass), without biliary stricture on conventional ultrasound and/or computed tomography were enrolled. The {EUS-FNA} biopsy was performed in 53 patients and cytology utilizing {ERP} was performed in 30 patients.
{RESULTS:} The sampling rate of adequate specimen was 100\% in both groups. In the {EUS-FNA} group, the overall results for the available samples were sensitivity 92.9\% and accuracy 94.3\%. In contrast, in the {ERCP} group, the overall results were sensitivity 33.3\% and accuracy 46.7\%. There was a significant difference between the two groups (P {\textless} 0.01). With regard to complications, there was a significant difference (P {\textless} 0.01) in the frequency of post-procedure pancreatitis between the {EUS-FNA} group and {ERP} group (0\%, 0/53 vs 33.3\%, 10/30, respectively).
{CONCLUSION:} Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration is safer and more accurate for the cytopathological diagnosis of suspected pancreatic masses without a biliary stricture as compared with cytology during {ERP.} Endoscopic ultrasonography with {FNA} should be considered a preferred test (prior to attempting endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) when a cytological diagnosis of a pancreatic mass is required, especially when there is no biliary obstruction, or when emergent decompression of an obstructed biliary tree is not considered clinically necessary due to lack of signs and symptoms of cholangitis.},

{PATIENTS} {AND} {METHODS:} Sixteen consecutive patients with masses in the uncinate process (n = 3), the head (n = 5), or the body and tail (n = 8) of the pancreas underwent both {EUS-TNB} and {EUS-FNAB.} The specimens obtained were evaluated by histopathological analysis alone
{RESULTS:} Tissue specimens were obtained by Trucut needle, and by 19-gauge and 22-gauge aspiration needles in 69 \%, 69 \%, and 100 \% of patients respectively. Sensitivity for malignancy was 69 \% for all needles. Tissue sampling by Trucut and by 19-gauge aspiration needle from masses in the uncinate process was impossible. The sensitivity of the Trucut and 19-gauge aspiration needles was 100 \% in the 11 patients with successful procedures. If Trucut or 19-gauge aspiration needles had been used for body and tail masses, and the 22-gauge aspiration needle for masses in the uncinate process and head, the sensitivity for malignancy would have been 81 \%.
{CONCLUSIONS:} {EUS-TNB} allows reliable tissue sampling for the diagnosis of pancreatic masses, but its use is limited to lesions in the body and tail of the pancreas. {EUS-FNAB} using a 22-gauge needle may be useful for accurate diagnosis in some patients with masses in the uncinate process or the head of the pancreas.},

All cases diagnosed as neoplasms were selected and those diagnosed as nonprimary pancreatic tumors were reviewed and analyzed. One hundred ninety-one of 468 cases were diagnosed as neoplasms. Eleven of these cases were diagnosed as nonprimary pancreatic tumors (2.4\% of all diagnoses and 5.7\% of all neoplasms). The diagnoses were supported by clinical history (n = 7), cytological findings (n = 11), cell block histology (n = 11), cell block immunohistochemistry (n = 6), and flow cytometry (n = 1). {EUS-FNA} is a safe and minimally invasive method for the diagnosis of nonprimary pancreatic neoplasms. Evaluation of clinical history, cytomorphology, and ancillary techniques, especially those applied to cell block material, are essential for accurate diagnoses.},

	abstract = {Some 25 years ago endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} was introduced in clinical practice for better visualization of pancreas. At the time of introduction {EUS} was superior to other methods in detection of pancreatic masses allowing tissue diagnosis by later introduced {EUS-guided} fine needle aspiration ({FNA).} During the time {EUS} was improved, electronic probes replaced mechanical probes adding ability of color Doppler, power Doppler, contrast enhanced endosonography as well as {EUS} elastography analysis. Meanwhile, {CT} technology has also experienced significant improvements raising the question whether {EUS} has lost ground in diagnostics of solid pancreatic masses. The aim of this review was to discuss the current evidence of clinical impact of {EUS} and {EUS-FNA} in evaluation of solid pancreatic masses with special emphasis on differentiation between benign and malignant pancreatic lesions. According to the literature, the detection of small pancreatic tumors, preoperative localization of pancreatic endocrine tumors and tissue sampling by fine-needle aspiration of pancreatic masses in cases with therapeutic consequences are considered firm indications for {EUS.} Cytological tissue analysis remains undisputed in differentiation benign from malignant lesions, but the question when {FNA} is needed is discussed. Color Doppler, power Doppler, contrast enhanced endosonography and especially elastography are also discussed as tools that are bringing additional information in evaluation of pancreatic masses, however insufficient for definitive judgment of the lesion's nature. Pancreatic cancer staging as indication for {EUS} is discussed controversially, inconsistent results and conflicting evidence in literature making adequate conclusion impossible. However, this indicates that at least the role of {EUS} is no longer undisputed in this matter. Resuming the role of {EUS} we can state that despite some controversies {EUS} is very valuable method in evaluation of solid pancreatic masses and with {EUS} guided {FNA} is nowadays by far the best method for obtaining tissue diagnosis.},

It is important to object the reflection of the patient's condition and pathology of each disease and remove pattern recognition in what they were depicted as an image. Visualization plays another important role in various medical diagnostics. Trends in scientific visualization will depend on advancements in molecular technology and computer hardware as well as trends in engineering disciplines.

{CONCLUSION:} As the most extensively evaluated marker, {CA} 19-9 should be used in contemporary algorithms for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. Elevated values should be repeated after relief of jaundice.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} \& {AIMS:} It is uncertain whether computed tomography ({CT)} or endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} is superior for the detection, staging, and resectability of pancreatic cancer. We therefore performed a systematic literature review to determine which test is more accurate.
{METHODS:} We identified relevant studies from {MEDLINE} (1986-2004) and evaluated study quality, which was measured on the basis of guidelines for assessing studies of diagnostic tests. Quantitative outcomes data were abstracted from the studies.
{RESULTS:} Eleven studies with 678 patients satisfied inclusion criteria. Nine studies assessed tumor detection, all of which concluded that the sensitivity of {EUS} was superior to {CT.} Four of 5 studies that assessed tumor staging accuracy and 5 of 8 that assessed nodal staging accuracy concluded that {EUS} was superior to {CT.} Among the 4 studies that assessed resectability, 2 showed no difference between {EUS} and {CT}, and 1 favored each modality. Three of 11 studies met all but one of the quality criteria. The most important and frequent study limitations were lack of a consecutive series of patients and biased patient selection for surgery. Quantitative comparisons among studies were precluded by differences in tumor staging classifications, surgical selection, {CT} and {EUS} techniques, and reporting of operating characteristics.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The published literature comparing {EUS} and {CT} for preoperative assessment of pancreatic cancer is heterogeneous in study design, quality, and results. All studies have methodologic limitations that potentially affect validity. Prospective studies with state-of-the-art imaging are needed to further define the role of each test.},

An ambiguous lesion whose appearance suggests a pancreatic origin requires a broad differential diagnosis that can subsequently be narrowed on the basis of both clinical history and features at optimal computed tomography ({CT)} and magnetic resonance ({MR)} imaging. Pancreas-specific multidetector {CT} and {MR} imaging techniques with thin collimation, multiplanar and multiphasic scans, and newly introduced curved planar reformation may help avoid potential diagnostic pitfalls. These techniques can help identify and characterize a mass in multiple viewing planes, thereby helping distinguish a true pancreatic neoplasm from peripancreatic adenopathy or from a tumor of the adjacent duodenum or small bowel. They can also help determine the cause of a tumor. It is important that the radiologist be familiar with the wide spectrum of anatomic variants and disease entities that can mimic primary pancreatic neoplasia in order to initiate the appropriate lesion-specific work-up and treatment and avoid unnecessary tests or procedures, including surgery.},

	abstract = {Most patients with pancreatic cancer present with a mass on radiologic studies, however, not every pancreatic mass is cancer. Since radiological studies alone are insufficient to establish the diagnosis of a pancreatic mass and patient management depends on a definitive diagnosis; confirmatory cytology or histology is usually required. As a minimally invasive procedure, {EUS} and {EUS} {FNA} avoid the risk of cutaneous or peritoneal contamination that may occur with {CT} or {US-guided} investigations and is less invasive than surgical interventions. As a result, {EUS} {FNA} of pancreatic masses is becoming the standard for obtaining cytological diagnosis. This chapter presents an {EUS-based} diagnostic algorithm for the evaluation of pancreatic lesions and is based upon a review of the pertinent literature in the field of pancreatic endosonography that has been the most influential in helping to guide this evolving field. Realizing there is much overlap among the {EUS} characteristics of various pancreatic lesions, for the sake of simplicity we have structured our discussion in broad terms of solid versus cystic lesions and discuss various pancreatic lesions within this framework. The additional contributors to this round table discussion have been asked to provide a more dedicated, focused discussion of the various subcategories of pancreatic lesions in greater detail than we could hope to achieve here. We provide this final contribution to the round table as a means of bringing the discussion back to the big picture of pancreatic lesions, rather than trying to hone in on the fine details of any one subclass.},

{METHODS:} A 49-expert multidisciplinary international consortium met to discuss pancreatic screening and vote on statements. Consensus was considered reached if ≥ 75\% agreed or disagreed.
{RESULTS:} There was excellent agreement that, to be successful, a screening programme should detect and treat {T1N0M0} margin-negative {PC} and high-grade dysplastic precursor lesions (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm). It was agreed that the following were candidates for screening: first-degree relatives ({FDRs)} of patients with {PC} from a familial {PC} kindred with at least two affected {FDRs;} patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome; and p16, {BRCA2} and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer ({HNPCC)} mutation carriers with ≥ 1 affected {FDR.} Consensus was not reached for the age to initiate screening or stop surveillance. It was agreed that initial screening should include endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS)} and/or {MRI/magnetic} resonance cholangiopancreatography not {CT} or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. There was no consensus on the need for {EUS} fine-needle aspiration to evaluate cysts. There was disagreement on optimal screening modalities and intervals for follow-up imaging. When surgery is recommended it should be performed at a high-volume centre. There was great disagreement as to which screening abnormalities were of sufficient concern to for surgery to be recommended.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Screening is recommended for high-risk individuals, but more evidence is needed, particularly for how to manage patients with detected lesions. Screening and subsequent management should take place at high-volume centres with multidisciplinary teams, preferably within research protocols.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer mortality in the United States, with 5-year survival rates for patients with resectable tumors ranging from 15\% to 20\%. However, most patients presenting with distant metastases, are not resectable, and have a 5-year survival rate of close to 0\%. This demonstrates a need for improved screening to identify pancreatic cancer while the tumor is still localized and amenable to surgical resection. Studies of patients with pancreatic tumors incidentally diagnosed demonstrate longer median  survival than tumors discovered only when the patient is symptomatic, suggesting  that early detection may improve outcome. Recent evidence from genomic sequencing indicates a 15-year interval for genetic progression of pancreatic cancer from initiation to the metastatic stage, suggesting a sufficient window for early detection. Still, many challenges remain in implementing effective screening. Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer relies on developing screening methodologies with highly sensitive and specific biomarkers and imaging modalities. It also depends on a better understanding of the risk factors and natural history of the  disease to accurately identify high-risk groups that would be best served by screening. This review summarizes our current understanding of the biology of pancreatic cancer relevant to methods available for screening. At this time, given the lack of proven benefit in this disease, screening efforts should probably be undertaken in the context of prospective trials.},

Parameters of the {IVIM} (intra-voxel incoherent motion) theory can be used to differentiate between those lesions. The objective of this work is to evaluate the effects of rigid image registration on {IVIM} derived parameters for differentiation of pancreatic lesions such as pancreatic cancer and solid mass forming pancreatitis. The effects of linear image registration methods on reproducibility and accuracy  of {IVIM} derived parameters were quantified on {MR} images of ten volunteers. For this purpose, they were evaluated statistically by comparison of registered and unregistered parameter data. Further, the perfusion fraction f was used to differentiate pancreatic lesions on eleven previously diagnosed patient data sets. Its diagnostic power with and without rigid registration was evaluated using receiver operating curves ({ROC)} analysis. The pancreas was segmented manually on {MR} data sets of healthy volunteers as well as the patients showing solid pancreatic lesions. Diffusion weighted imaging was performed in 10 blocks of breath-hold phases. Linear registration of the weighted image stack leads to a 3.7\% decrease in variability of the {IVIM} derived parameter f due to an improved anatomical overlap of 5\%. Consequently, after registration the area under the curve in the {ROC-analysis} for the differentiation approach increased by 2.7\%. In  conclusion, rigid registration improves the differentiation process based on f-values.},

Despite new developments in imaging techniques, surgery and oncologic treatments, survival rate remains unchanged. In order to improve the outcome of this disease, it would be of interest the development of a screening program trying to detect small asymptomatic tumors or  precursor lesions at the time when the disease is still at a curable stage. Although screening in general population is not feasible nowadays, screening programs in high risk individuals may be of help in this setting. A specific population has been defined to be screened, those with a {\textgreater}10-fold increased risk  for developing the disease (inherited {PC} syndromes due to inherited gene mutations and individuals with a strong family history of {PC} with at least 2 first-degree relatives affected, but without a known genetic defect). Regarding the methods for screening, endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} and magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} appears to be the most accurate, mainly based in their ability to detect those small pancreatic tumors and precursor lesions (like {IPMN} and {PanIN} lesions). In these patients screening should start at the age of 45, or 15 years  earlier than the earliest occurrence of {PC} in the family, whichever is the earlier age.

Of these patients, 31 underwent {EUS} and 33 {MRI.} {EUS} revealed two patients with pancreatic cancer (one resectable, one metastatic), five with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms ({IPMN)}, seven with cysts, and six with parenchymal changes. Five had pancreatic surgery (one total pancreatectomy for pancreatic cancer, three distal and one central pancreatectomy for pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia 2 and {IPMN).} A total of 24 (47\%) had genetic testing (19 for {BRCA1/2} mutations, 4 for {CDKN2A}, 1 for {MLH1/MSH2)} and 7 were positive for {BRCA1/2} mutations.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} Epidemiologic and experimental studies suggest that dietary fat intake may affect risk of pancreatic cancer, but published results are inconsistent.
{METHODS:} We examined risk associations for specific types of dietary fat intakes and related food sources among 111,416 participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to examine associations between fat intake and pancreatic cancer risk.
{RESULTS:} Over a mean 8.4 years of follow-up, 411 pancreatic cancer cases were identified. We observed an inverse association between saturated fat intake and pancreatic cancer risk (hazard ratio [{HR]}, 0.64 comparing extreme quintiles; 95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 0.46-0.88), but the association became weaker and nonsignificant when individuals with fewer than 4 years of follow-up were excluded to avoid possible reverse causation ({HR}, 0.88; 95\% {CI}, 0.58-1.33). Total fat intake showed a similar pattern of association, whereas intakes of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and fats from animal or plant sources showed no associations with risk.
{CONCLUSIONS:} These results do not support the hypothesis of increased pancreatic cancer risk with higher fat consumption overall or by specific fat type or source. Dietary changes owing to undetected disease may explain the observed inverse association with saturated fat.},

Patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma have a poor outcome and more than 95\% of the people affected die from the disease within 12 mo after diagnosis. Surgery is the first-line treatment in the case of resectable neoplasm, but only 20\% of patients are candidates for this approach. One of the reasons there are few candidates for surgery is that, during the early phases of the disease, the symptoms are poor or non-specific. Early diagnosis is of crucial importance to improve patient outcome; therefore, we are looking for a good screening test. The screening test must identify the disease in an early stage in order to be effective; having said this, a need exists to introduce the concept of "early" ductal adenocarcinoma. It has been reported that at least five additional years after the occurrence of the initiating mutation are required for the acquisition of metastatic ability of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and patients die an average of two years thereafter. We have reviewed the most recent literature in order to evaluate the present and future perspectives of screening programs of this deadly disease.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} \& {AIMS:} The risk of pancreatic cancer is increased in patients with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer or a predisposing germline mutation. Screening can detect curable, noninvasive pancreatic neoplasms, but the optimal imaging approach is not known. We determined the baseline prevalence and characteristics of pancreatic abnormalities using 3 imaging tests to screen asymptomatic, high-risk individuals ({HRIs).}
{METHODS:} We screened 225 asymptomatic adult {HRIs} at 5 academic {US} medical centers once, using computed tomography ({CT)}, magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)}, and endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS).} We compared results in a blinded, independent fashion.
{RESULTS:} Ninety-two of 216 {HRIs} (42\%) were found to have at least 1 pancreatic mass (84 cystic, 3 solid) or a dilated pancreatic duct (n = 5) by any of the imaging modalities. Fifty-one of the 84 {HRIs} with a cyst (60.7\%) had multiple lesions, typically small (mean, 0.55 cm; range, 2-39 mm), in multiple locations. The prevalence of pancreatic lesions increased with age; they were detected in 14\% of subjects younger than 50 years old, 34\% of subjects 50-59 years old, and 53\% of subjects 60-69 years old (P {\textless} .0001). {CT}, {MRI}, and {EUS} detected a pancreatic abnormality in 11\%, 33.3\%, and 42.6\% of the {HRIs}, respectively. Among these abnormalities, proven or suspected neoplasms were identified in 85 {HRIs} (82 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and 3 pancreatic endocrine tumors). Three of 5 {HRIs} who underwent pancreatic resection had high-grade dysplasia in less than 3 cm intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and in multiple intraepithelial neoplasias.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Screening of asymptomatic {HRIs} frequently detects small pancreatic cysts, including curable, noninvasive high-grade neoplasms. {EUS} and {MRI} detect pancreatic lesions better than {CT.}},

{METHODS:} A prospective cohort study was undertaken between 2003 and 2011 at a tertiary care centre in Toronto, Canada. Two hundred and sixty-two subjects were enrolled based on an elevated estimated lifetime risk for pancreatic cancer due to known genetic mutations and/or cancer family history. Subjects underwent annual magnetic resonance imaging, followed by additional investigations if abnormal findings were detected. Evidence of malignancy or suspicious macroscopic abnormalities prompted referral for surgical intervention.
{RESULTS:} Average length of follow-up was 4.2 years, during which 84/262 (32\%) subjects demonstrated pancreatic abnormalities. Three participants developed pancreatic adenocarcinoma (one 1.5-cm tumor was resected but recurred, while the other two subjects developed metastatic cancer), and a fourth participant developed a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that was resected. Fifteen subjects had radiologic evidence of branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, of which two underwent surgical resection. Sixty-five subjects had simple pancreatic cysts that have remained stable.
{CONCLUSION:} Magnetic resonance imaging can detect small pancreatic tumors and cystic lesions, but further improvement in sensitivity is needed. An understanding of the natural history of pre-invasive lesions in members of high-risk families is necessary for developing a more effective screening program.},

{OBJECTIVE:} To determine whether early pancreatic neoplasia can be detected in a high-risk population by using {CA} 19-9 followed by targeted {EUS.}
{DESIGN:} Prospective cohort study.
{SETTING:} Two academic medical centers.
{PATIENTS:} Eligible patients met age criteria and had at least 1 first-degree relative with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
{INTERVENTIONS:} A serum {CA} 19-9 was performed on all patients. {EUS} was performed if the {CA} 19-9 level was elevated. {FNA} of identified lesions was performed. Patients with pancreatic cancer detected by using this screening protocol were compared with patients presenting off-protocol for staging data. Medicare reimbursement rates were used to derive cost data.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} Detection of early pancreatic neoplasia.
{RESULTS:} A total of 546 patients were enrolled. {CA} 19-9 was elevated in 27 patients (4.9\%, 95\% {CI}, 3.2\%-7.1\%). Neoplastic or malignant findings were detected in 5 patients (0.9\%, 95\% {CI}, 0.3\%-2.1\%), and pancreatic adenocarcinoma in 1 patient (0.2\%, 95\% {CI}, 0.005\%-1.02\%). The patient with pancreatic cancer detected as part of this protocol was 1 of 2 patients presenting to the University of Vermont with stage 1 cancer. The cost to detect 1 pancreatic neoplasia was \$8431. The cost to detect 1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma was \$41,133.
{LIMITATIONS:} The sample size is adequate only to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Potentially curative pancreatic adenocarcinoma can be identified with this screening protocol. Stage 1 pancreatic cancer is more likely to be detected by using this screening protocol than by using standard means of detection.},

	abstract = {To identify novel targets in pancreatic cancer cells, we used high-throughput {RNAi} ({HT-RNAi)} to select genes that, when silenced, would decrease viability of pancreatic cancer cells. The {HT-RNAi} screen involved reverse transfecting the pancreatic cancer cell line {BxPC3} with a {siRNA} library targeting 572 kinases. From replicate screens, approximately 32 kinases were designated as hits, of which 22 kinase targets were selected for confirmation and validation. One kinase identified as a hit from this screen was tyrosine kinase nonreceptor 1 ({TNK1)}, a kinase previously identified as having tumor suppressor-like properties in embryonic stem cells. Silencing of {TNK1} with {siRNA} showed reduced proliferation in a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we showed that silencing of {TNK1} led to increased apoptosis through a caspase-dependent pathway and that targeting {TNK1} with {siRNA} can synergize with gemcitabine treatment. Despite previous reports that {TNK1} affects Ras and {NF-κB} signaling, we did not find similar correlations with these pathways in pancreatic cancer cells. Our results suggest that {TNK1} in pancreatic cancer cells does not possess the same tumor suppressor properties seen in embryonic cells but seems to be involved in growth and survival. The application of functional genomics by using {HT-RNAi} screens has allowed us to identify {TNK1} as a growth-associated kinase in pancreatic cancer cells.},

The screening protocol includes genetic counselling, transcutaneous abdominal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and blood collection and eligible participants included individuals with a family history of pancreatic cancer or {BRCA2} mutation carriers. At baseline, participants (n = 198) showed low to moderate levels of risk perception, pancreatic cancer-related anxiety, and general distress.

{RESULTS:} Forty-four individuals ({M/F} 18/26), aged 32-75 years underwent screening with {EUS.} Thirteen were from families with familial atypical multiple-mole melanoma ({FAMMM)}, 21 with {FPC}, 3 individuals were diagnosed with hereditary pancreatitis, 2 were Peutz-Jeghers patients, 3 were {BRCA1} and 2 were {BRCA2} mutation carriers with familial clustering of {PC}, and 1 individual had a p53 mutation. Three (6.8\%) patients had an asymptomatic mass lesion (12, 27, and 50 mm) in the body (n=2) or tail of the pancreas. All lesions were completely resected. Pathology showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas with N1 disease in the two patients with the largest lesions. {EUS} showed branch-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia ({IPMN)} in seven individuals.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Screening of individuals at a high risk for {PC} with {EUS} is feasible and safe. The incidence of clinically relevant findings at first screening is high with asymptomatic cancer in 7\% and premalignant {IPMN-like} lesions in 16\% in our series. Whether screening improves survival remains to be determined, as does the optimal screening interval with {EUS.}},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} Familial pancreatic cancer ({FPC)} accounts for approximately 3\% of all pancreatic cancer ({PC)} cases. It has been suggested that high-risk individuals ({HRIs)} should be offered a screening programme.
{AIM:} To evaluate the diagnostic yield of a prospective screening programme in {HRIs} from families with {FPC} over a period of 5 years.
{METHODS:} {HRIs} of families with {FPC} of the National German Familial Pancreatic Cancer Registry ({FaPaCa)} were counselled and enrolled in a prospective, board-approved {PC} screening programme. Screening included clinical examination, laboratory tests, endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)} and {MRI} with magnetic resonance cholangiopancreaticography ({MRCP)} and {MR} angiography.
{RESULTS:} Between June 2002 and December 2007, 76 {HRIs} of families with {FPC} took part in the screening programme with a total of 182 examination visits. Twenty-eight patients revealed abnormalities in {EUS} (n = 25) and/or {MR/MRCP} (n = 12). In 7 patients fine needle aspiration cytology was performed. Operative pancreatic explorations were performed in 7 individuals, resulting in limited resections in 6 cases. Histopathological examination of the resected specimens showed serous oligocystic adenomas (n = 3), pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia 1 ({PanIN1)} lesions with lobular fibrosis (n = 1), {PanIN2} lesions (n = 1) and {PanIN1} lesion plus a gastric type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ({IPMN)} (n = 1).
{CONCLUSIONS:} In {FPC} an {EUS/MR/MRCP-based} screening programme leads to the detection of potential precursor lesions of {PC.} However, the yield of an extensive screening programme is low, especially since the tumourigenic value of low grade {PanIN} lesions is not yet defined. Taking into account the enormous psychological stress for the tested individual and the high costs, a general {PC} screening in {HRIs} is not justified.},

{RECENT} {FINDINGS:} Publication of initial results of screening for pancreatic cancer from {US} centres. Several masses and premalignant lesions have been detected, but the detection of the first pancreatic cancer through an organised study of screening has yet to be published. There has been progress in risk stratification; the role of diabetes in predisposing for cancer has been characterised and molecular modalities have been published which could be used in conjunction with imaging in a screening programme. A mutation in the palladin gene was found to segregate with the disease in a family with a clear predisposition for pancreatic cancer, though this has yet to be found in other such kindreds.
{SUMMARY:} Significant challenges remain to be solved in screening for early pancreatic cancer. Risk stratification needs to be improved and high-risk patients included in research-based screening programmes. It will be impossible to confirm that screening can detect cancers early enough for curative treatment until the results of these prospective studies become available.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Timely, accurate diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma ({PA)} is hampered by the lack of effective circulating biomarkers. No single test has emerged that improves upon the commonly used biomarker cancer antigen 19-9 ({CA} 19-9) to discriminate {PA} from benign conditions effectively. The goals of this study were to validate two acute-phase proteins, haptoglobin and serum amyloid A ({SAA)}, as biomarkers for {PA} and determine if the combination of haptoglobin, {SAA}, and {CA} 19-9 would improve {PA} diagnosis over {CA} 19-9 alone.
{METHODS:} Levels of haptoglobin, {SAA}, and {CA} 19-9 were measured in pretreatment sera from 75 {PA} patients, 32 patients with chronic pancreatitis, 42 patients with other benign pancreatic disease or biliary stricture, and 150 healthy control subjects by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or colorimetric binding assay. Relative levels of haptoglobin or {SAA} were compared between groups using analysis of variance. The diagnostic accuracy of serum haptoglobin and {SAA} levels were investigated using receiver operating characteristics ({ROC)} analysis. Using classification tree analysis, an algorithm was developed that used haptoglobin, {SAA}, and {CA} 19-9 in a diagnostic screening panel.
{RESULTS:} Both haptoglobin and {SAA} were significantly elevated in sera from {PA} patients compared to healthy control subjects (p{\textless}0.0001) and patients with chronic pancreatitis (p=0.01). Haptoglobin was significantly elevated in sera from {PA} patients relative to patients with other benign diseases (p=0.0015), whereas {SAA} fell short of significance in the same comparison (p=0.0508). {ROC} analysis indicated that haptoglobin [area under the curve ({AUC)=0.792]} was a better diagnostic marker than {SAA} ({AUC=0.691)} over multiple threshold cutoffs. Using specific cutoffs that minimized overall misclassification, haptoglobin yielded a sensitivity of 82.7\% and a specificity of 71.1\%, and {SAA} yielded a sensitivity of 34.7\% and a specificity of 90.2\% when discriminating {PA} cases from all non-{PA} controls. In the same sample set, {CA} 19-9 yielded a sensitivity of 77.3\% and a specificity of 91.1\%. Combining data from haptoglobin, {SAA}, and {CA} 19-9 in a diagnostic screening panel improved the overall accuracy when compared to {CA} 19-9 alone, yielding a sensitivity of 81.3\% and a specificity of 95.5\%.
{CONCLUSIONS:} These data demonstrate that haptoglobin and {SAA} are useful for discriminating {PA} from benign conditions as well as healthy controls when used in a diagnostic screening panel. This study supports the use of combined biomarkers for improved accuracy in the diagnosis of {PA.}},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Pancreatic cancer represents the fourth-leading cause of cancer death in the United States, with a dismal 5-year survival rate of less than 5\%. Despite advancements in screening and early detection of other cancers such as breast and colon cancer, no reliable screening test exists for pancreatic cancer. Subsequently, the majority of patients present with advanced-stage disease leading to a poor prognosis. Because of the relatively low incidence, current efforts are focused on early detection and screening only in patients at high risk for the development of the disease.
{METHODS:} We discuss the practical considerations encountered when determining if an individual should be screened for pancreatic cancer. The current literature was reviewed regarding risk factors, genetic syndromes, screening modalities, and screening studies of pancreatic cancer. The current high-risk pancreatic screening program at our institute is also summarized.
{RESULTS:} Current efforts to detect pancreatic cancer at a curative phase are focused on screening individuals at high risk for the development of this disease. They include kindreds with two or more first-degree relatives affected with this disease and those with known hereditary pancreatic cancer syndromes. Hereditary pancreatic cancer syndromes include Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, familial breast cancer syndrome, and familial atypical multiple mole melanoma syndrome. Of all the screening modalities available, endoscopic ultrasound is the most sensitive and specific screening tool to evaluate the pancreas and has been proven to detect early precancerous and cancerous changes in clinical studies.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Early detection and screening for pancreatic cancer in the current state should be limited to high-risk patients, although hereditary/familial factors account for only 10\% of patients with pancreatic cancer. Continued efforts are needed to discover effective test to identify patients with nonhereditary risk factors who will benefit from screening and also to develop less invasive and more cost-effective screening modalities aimed at controlling pancreatic cancer.},

This study screened for early pancreatic neoplasia and compared the pancreatic abnormalities in high-risk individuals and control subjects.
{METHODS:} High-risk individuals with {PJS} or a strong family history of pancreatic cancer were prospectively evaluated with baseline and 12-month computed tomography ({CT)} scan and endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS).} If {EUS} was abnormal, {EUS-fine-needle} aspiration and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ({ERCP)} were performed. Surgery was offered to patients with potentially neoplastic lesions. Radiologic findings and pathologic diagnoses were compared. Patients undergoing {EUS} and/or {ERCP} for benign non-pancreatic indications were concurrently enrolled as control subjects.
{RESULTS:} Seventy-eight high-risk patients (72 from familial pancreatic cancer kindreds, 6 {PJS)} and 149 control patients were studied. To date, 8 patients with pancreatic neoplasia have been confirmed by surgery or fine-needle aspiration (10\% yield of screening); 6 patients had 8 benign intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms ({IPMNs)}, 1 had an {IPMN} that progressed to invasive ductal adenocarcinoma, and 1 had pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia. {EUS} and {CT} also diagnosed 3 patients with 5 extrapancreatic neoplasms.

	abstract = {Hereditary pancreatitis is an autosomal dominant disease with incomplete penetrance (80\%), accounting for approximately 1\% of all cases of pancreatitis. It is characterized by the onset of recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis in childhood and frequent progression to chronic pancreatitis. Whitcomb et al. identified the cationic trypsinogen gene ({PRSS1)} on chromosome 7q35 as the site of the mutation that causes hereditary pancreatitis. The European registry of hereditary pancreatitis and familial pancreatic cancer ({EUROPAC)} aims to identify and make provisions for those affected by hereditary pancreatitis and familial pancreatic cancer. The most common mutations in hereditary pancreatitis are {R122H}, {N29I} and {A16V} but many families have been described with clinically defined hereditary pancreatitis where there is no {PRSS1} mutation. It is known that the cumulative lifetime risk (to age 70 years) of pancreatic cancer is 40\% in individuals with hereditary pancreatitis. This subset of individuals form an ideal group for the development of a screening programme aimed at detecting pancreatic cancer at an early stage in an attempt to improve the presently poor long-term survival. Current screening strategies involve multimodality imaging (computed tomography, endoluminal ultrasound) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for pancreatic juice collection followed by molecular analysis of the {DNA} extracted from the juice. The potential benefit of screening (curative resection) must be balanced against the associated morbidity and mortality of surgery. Philosophically, the individual's best interest must be sought in light of the latest advances in medicine and science following discussions with a multidisciplinary team in specialist pancreatic centres.},

{METHODS:} Individuals from familial pancreatic cancer kindreds and a patient with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome underwent screening endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS).} If the {EUS} was abnormal, {EUS-guided} fine-needle aspiration, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ({ERCP)}, and spiral computed tomography ({CT)} were performed. Patients with abnormalities suggesting neoplasia had surgery.
{RESULTS:} Thirty-eight patients were studied; 31 (mean age, 58 yr; 42\% men) from kindreds with {\textgreater} or =3 affected with pancreatic cancer; 6 from kindreds with 2 affected relatives, 1 was a patient with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. None had symptoms referable to the pancreas or suggestive of malignancy. Six pancreatic masses were found by {EUS:} 1 invasive ductal adenocarcinoma, 1 benign intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm, 2 serous cystadenomas, and 2 nonneoplastic masses. Hence, the diagnostic yield for detecting clinically significant pancreatic neoplasms was 5.3\% (2 of 38). The 1 patient with pancreatic cancer was treated and still is alive and disease-free {\textgreater}5 years after surgery. {EUS} changes similar to those associated with chronic pancreatitis were found, which were more common in patients with a history of regular alcohol intake (P = 0.02), but also occurred in patients who did not consume alcohol. Screening also led to a new diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic upper-gastrointestinal conditions in 18.4\% of patients.

{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN:} We measured 735 {miRNAs} in pancreatic cancer case and control sera by {QRTPCR} using {TaqMan} {MicroRNA} Arrays. After array analysis, we selected 18 {miRNA} candidates for validation in an independent set of cases and control samples.
{RESULTS:} Of the significantly elevated circulating {miRNAs} in patients with pancreatic cancer compared with controls, {miR-1290} had the best diagnostic performance: receiver operating characteristic ({ROC)} analysis on {miR-1290} serum level yielded curve areas ({AUC)} of 0.96 [95\% confidence interval ({CI)}, 0.91-1.00], 0.81 (0.71-0.91), and 0.80 (0.67-0.93), for subjects with pancreatic cancer (n = 41) relative to healthy controls (n = 19), subjects with chronic pancreatitis (n = 35), and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (n = 18), respectively. Serum {miR-1290} levels were also significantly higher than healthy controls among patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm ({IPMN;} n = 20; {AUC} = 0.76, 0.61-0.91). Serum {miR-1290} levels distinguished patients with low-stage pancreatic cancer from controls better than {CA19-9} levels, and like {CA19-9}, higher {miR-1290} levels predicted poorer outcome among patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy. Greater numbers of {miR-1290} transcripts were detected by {FISH} in primary pancreatic cancer and {IPMN} than normal pancreatic duct cells. {miR-1290} influenced in vitro pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and invasive ability. Several other circulating {miRNAs} distinguished sera of patients with pancreatic cancer from those of healthy controls with {AUCs} {\textgreater}0.7, including {miR-24}, {miR-134}, {miR-146a}, {miR-378}, {miR-484}, {miR-628-3p}, and {miR-1825.}
{CONCLUSIONS:} The detection of elevated circulating {miR-1290} has the potential to improve the early detection of pancreatic cancer.},

In this review, we summarize the literature on {CA-19-9} in {PDA} and highlight the most promising investigational biomarkers.

Knowing that, adipokines could regulate insulin resistance, inflammation, immunity and carcinogenesis. Accordingly, an understanding of adipokines in relation to pancreatic cancer could be useful to improve disease outcome. We aimed to determine serum retinol binding protein-4 ({RBP-4)} and neutophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ({NGAL)} levels in pancreatic cancer patients. Moreover, we assessed their association with tumor severity and with each other.
{METHODS:} A total of 23 pancreatic cancer patients and 20 healthy controls were enrolled. Fifteen of the pancreatic cancer patients underwent Whipple resection and were examined before and after operation. Serum glucose, insulin, lipid profile, {CA19-9}, {RBP-4} and {NGAL} were estimated by {ELISA.}
{RESULTS:} Significant elevation in serum concentrations of {RBP-4} (64.4 ± 5.6 ng/ml) and {NGAL} (142(80-235) ng/ml) at p {\textless} 0.001 was found in pancreatic cancer patients. Both {RBP-4} and {NGAL} were significantly lower after operation than before operation. Moreover, {NGAL} was elevated in advanced pathological T stage. Interestingly, {RBP-4} and {NGAL} levels were positively correlated (r = 0.484, p = 0.05) and they are associated with some of the lipid profile parameters.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Elevated serum {RBP-4} and {NGAL} are associated with pancreatic cancer. They were positively interrelated; highlighting the possible interplay between them in pancreatic cancer.},

The aim of this study was to discover potential biomarkers for pancreatic cancer ({PCa)} using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry ({SELDI-TOF-MS).} Crude serum samples from 132 patients with {PCa} and 67 healthy controls ({HCs)} were analyzed in duplicate using {SELDI.} Support vector machine ({SVM)} analysis of the spectra was used to generate a predictive algorithm based on proteins that were maximally differentially expressed between patients with {PCa} and the {HCs} in the training cohort. This algorithm was tested using leave-one-out cross-validation in the test cohort. From the 4 significant peaks in the training cohort, a classifier for separating patients with {PCa} from {HCs} was developed. The classifier was challenged with all samples achieving 96.67\% sensitivity and 100\% specificity in the training cohort and 93.1\% sensitivity and 78.57\% specificity in the test cohort. Additionally, the classifier correctly classified 12/12 stage Ia and 13/16 stage {IIa} {PCa} cases. The combination of the {SELDI} panel and {CA19-9} was superior to {CA19-9} alone in distinguishing individuals with {PCa} from the healthy subject group.

This method is time consuming and often fails to provide suitable specimens for modern molecular analyses. Here, we compare the cytological approach with direct formalin fixation of pancreatic {EUS-FNA} micro-cores and evaluate the potential to perform molecular biomarker analysis on these specimen.
{METHODS:} 130 specimens obtained by {EUS-FNA} with a {22G} needle were processed by the standard cytological approach and compared to a separate cohort of 130 specimens that were immediately formalin fixed to preserve micro-cores of tissue prior to routine histological processing.
{RESULTS:} We found that direct formalin fixation significantly shortened the time required for diagnosis from 3.6 days to 2.9 days (p{\textless}0.05) by reducing the average time (140 vs 33 min/case) and number of slides (9.65 vs 4.67 slides/case) for histopathological processing. Specificity and sensitivity yielded comparable results between the two approaches (82.3\% vs 77\% and 90.9\% vs 100\%). Importantly, {EUS-FNA} histology preserved the tumour tissue architecture with neoplastic glands embedded in stroma in 67.89\% of diagnostic cases compared to 27.55\% with the standard cytological approach (p {\textless} 0.001). Furthermore, micro-core samples were suitable for molecular studies including the immunohistochemical detection of intranuclear Hes1 in malignant cells, and the laser-capture microdissection-mediated measurement of Gli-1 {mRNA} in tumour stromal myofibroblasts.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Direct formalin fixation of pancreatic {EUS-FNA} micro-cores demonstrates superiority regarding diagnostic delay, costs, and specimen suitability for molecular studies. We advocate this approach for future investigational trials in pancreatic cancer patients.},

{METHODS:} We performed a retrospective review of {CA19-9} levels (U/ml) in 483 consecutive patients between 2006 and 2008 at two university hospitals. We abstracted clinical, radiographic, and pathological data and final diagnoses. Descriptive and non-parametric analyses were performed.
{RESULTS:} Patients presenting with jaundice had the highest {CA19-9} (420) compared to other complaints ({\textless}20) (p{\textless}0.01). The indications with the highest {CA19-9} had evidence of biliary obstruction (71), liver mass (54), and pancreatic head mass (27) compared to other indications ({\textless}15) (p{\textless}0.01). The diagnoses with the highest {CA19-9} (p{\textless}0.01) were cholangiocarcinoma (476), pancreatic cancer (161), and choledocholithiasis (138). Using a receiver operator curve to evaluate {CA19-9}, the area under the curve was 0.7 when evaluating all patients for pancreatic cancer or cholangiocarcinoma or patients with pancreatic head mass for pancreatic cancer.

Serum {ATX} activity was not increased in patients with chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cysts. In the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, the area under the receiver operating curve for serum {ATX} activity was 0.541 (95\% {CI}, 0.435-0.648) for men and 0.772 (95\% {CI}, 0.659-0.885) for women. No significant correlation was observed between serum {ATX} activity and {CEA}, {CA19-9} or Dupan2 levels.
{CONCLUSION:} Serum {ATX} activity may be useful for identifying pancreatic cancer when used together with other serum markers of pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} To establish new biomarkers for accurate diagnosis of pancreatic cancer ({PC)} using a standardized serum peptidome profiling and compare the results with those from the tumor marker, {CA} 19-9.
{METHODS:} Serum samples from 102 patients (55 with chronic pancreatitis and 47 with {PC)} and 56 healthy controls were collected and analyzed following a protocol that was rigorously designed to prevent preanalytical variation. Serum peptides were extracted using immobilized copper ion chromatography on a robotic platform. Mass spectra were acquired by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time-of-flight mass spectrometry on an Autoflex {II} spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Statistical analysis was performed using the Clinprotools 2.2 software (Bruker Daltonics) and the {SPSS} 15.0 software ({SPSS} Inc, Chicago, Ill).
{RESULTS:} Standardized peptidome profiling showed a median coefficient of variation of 11.6\% calculated using all the extracted peptides and negligible influence of sex and age on peptidome profiles. The diagnostic sensitivity was 89.9\%, and the diagnostic specificity was 92.7\%, using 2 serum features and {CA} 19-9 serum concentration. Healthy controls were differentiated from patients with {PC} and chronic pancreatitis, with the use of 3 features of the peptidome (diagnostic sensitivity, 98.2\%; diagnostic specificity, 97.1\%).

{METHODS:} Serum samples from five individuals with pancreatic cancer and five individuals without cancer were compared. Highly abundant serum proteins were depleted by immuno-affinity column. Differential protein analysis was performed using 2-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis ({2D-DIGE).}
{RESULTS:} Among these protein spots, we found that 16 protein spots were differently expressed between the two mixtures; 8 of these were up-regulated and 8 were down-regulated in cancer. Mass spectrometry and database searching allowed the identification of the proteins corresponding to the gel spots. Up-regulation of mannose-binding lectin 2 and myosin light chain kinase 2, which have not previously been implicated in pancreatic cancer, were observed. In an independent series of serum samples from 16 patients with pancreatic cancer and 16 non-cancer-bearing controls, increased levels of mannose-binding lectin 2 and myosin light chain kinase 2 were confirmed by western blot.
{CONCLUSIONS:} These results suggest that affinity column enrichment and {DIGE} can be used to identify proteins differentially expressed in serum from pancreatic cancer patients. These two proteins 'mannose-binding lectin 2 and myosin light chain kinase 2' might be potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of the pancreatic cancer.},

{AIM:} The aim of this study was to assess the utility of the combination of multi-detector computed tomographic ({MDCT)} findings and serum carbohydrate antigen ({CA)19-9} level in the diagnosis of lymph node metastasis in biliary and pancreas carcinomas.
{METHODS:} The subjects were 139 patients with biliary and pancreas carcinomas who underwent surgical resection. We calculated the positive predictive values ({PPV)}, sensitivities, specificities, positive likelihood ratios ({PLR)} and accuracies of diagnosis by {MDCT} alone, serum {CA19-9} level alone, and their combination.
{RESULTS:} The {PPV} and sensitivity were higher for node metastasis in hepatoduodenal ligament than in common hepatic artery ({CHA)} or para-aortic region ({PAR).} Specificity, accuracy and {PLR} were highest for {CHA} in biliary carcinoma. With pancreatic carcinoma, {PLR} was slightly higher in {PAR} compared to other regions. The sensitivity of {CA19-9} for node metastasis was higher than that of {MDCT}, while the {PPV}, specificity, accuracy and {PLR} were low for both biliary and pancreas carcinoma. The combination of positive {CT} findings and high {CA19-9} level had the highest positive rate for node metastasis for both types of carcinomas. Nodes around the supra-mesenteric vein could not be fully observed on {CT.}

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} Mass spectrometry-based serum peptidome profiling is a promising tool to identify novel disease-associated biomarkers, but is limited by preanalytic factors and the intricacies of complex data processing. Therefore, we investigated whether standardized sample protocols and new bioinformatic tools combined with external data validation improve the validity of peptidome profiling for the discovery of pancreatic cancer-associated serum markers.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN:} For the discovery study, two sets of sera from patients with pancreatic cancer (n = 40) and healthy controls (n = 40) were obtained from two different clinical centers. For external data validation, we collected an independent set of samples from patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 20). Magnetic beads with different surface functionalities were used for peptidome fractionation followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight ({MALDI-TOF)} mass spectrometry ({MS).} Data evaluation was carried out by comparing two different bioinformatic strategies. Following proteome database search, the matching candidate peptide was verified by {MALDI-TOF} {MS} after specific antibody-based immunoaffinity chromatography and independently confirmed by an {ELISA} assay.
{RESULTS:} Two significant peaks (m/z 3884; 5959) achieved a sensitivity of 86.3\% and a specificity of 97.6\% for the discrimination of patients and healthy controls in the external validation set. Adding peak m/z 3884 to conventional clinical tumor markers ({CA} 19-9 and {CEA)} improved sensitivity and specificity, as shown by receiver operator characteristics curve analysis ({AUROC(combined)} = 1.00). Mass spectrometry-based m/z 3884 peak identification and following immunologic quantitation revealed platelet factor 4 as the corresponding peptide.

{RESULTS:} Univariate prognostic analyses of the 5-year disease-specific survival ({DSS)} revealed that {JPS} stage (P {\textless} 0.0001), preoperative serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 ({CA19-9)} level ({preCA19-9;} P {\textless} 0.0001), dissected peripancreatic tissue margin ({DPM;} P {\textless} 0.0001), residual tumor (R factor; P = 0.0007), lymph node metastasis density over 10\% ({ND10;} P = 0.006), volume of the stromal connective tissue (stroma factor; P = 0.008), growth pattern (P = 0.01), and histology (P = 0.03) were all significantly associated with poor outcome in advanced pancreatic cancer. Multivariate logistic analysis confirmed that {preCA19-9} [P = 0.0006, relative risk ({RR)} = 2.16] and {DPM} (P = 0.04, {RR} = 1.62) were prognostic factors that remained, independent of {JPS} stage (P = 0.001). The higher {preCA19-9} was, the worse the prognosis was. Astonishingly, among {JPS} stage {III} cases, 76.9\% of the patients with {preCA19-9} below 37 U/ml survived more than 5 years.

Biochemical diagnostics of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is based on determination of carcinoma antigen ({CA} 19-9) in the blood. Determination of N-acetyl-beta-hexosaminidase ({HEX)} in the serum and urine was used in diagnosis of renal and gastric cancers. Therefore the aim of our research was to estimate N-acetyl-beta-hexosaminidase ({HEX)} and its isoenzymes ({HEX} A and {HEX} B) in the serum and urine as potential markers of pancreatic cancer.
{METHODOLOGY:} Serum and urine samples were collected from 15 patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and 15 healthy persons. The activity of N-acetyl-beta-hexosaminidase and its isoenzymes (A and B) was determined by a colorimetric method of Zwierz et al. Absorbancy of the yellow product of the colorimetric reaction was determined on the microplate reader {EL(x)800} produced by {BIO-TEK.} The concentration of {HEX}, {HEX} A and B was expressed in {pKat/mL}, and the specific activity in {pKat/mg} of protein. Protein concentration was determined in the serum by the biuret and in the urine by the Lowry method, respectively, and expressed in {mg/mL.}
{RESULTS:} The concentration and specific activity of {HEX} and its isoenzyme A were significantly higher in the serum and urine of pancreatic cancer patients in comparison with the concentration and specific activity in the serum and urine of healthy people.

{METHODS:} Serum {CA19-9} levels were measured in 104 patients with pancreatic cancer which were possible to be resected according to the imaging. {ROC} curve was plotted for the {CA19-9} levels. The point closest to the upper left-hand corner of the graph were chosen as the cut-off point. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of {CA19-9} at this cut-off point were calculated.
{RESULTS:} Resectable pancreatic cancer was detected in 58 (55.77\%) patients and unresectable pancreatic cancer was detected in 46 (44.23\%) patients. The area under the {ROC} curve was 0.918 and 95\% {CI} was 0.843-0.992.

	abstract = {Major advances in cancer control will be greatly aided by early detection for diagnosing and treating cancer in its preinvasive state before metastasis. Unfortunately, for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ({PDAC)}, which is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States, effective early detection and screening are currently not available and tumors are typically diagnosed at a late stage, frequently after metastasis. Partly because of low sensitivity/specificity, existing biomarkers such as {CA19-9} are not adequate as early detection markers of pancreatic cancer. Thus, a great need exists for new biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. This article focuses on recent developments in the identification of new serum protein biomarkers that are useful in the early detection of {PDAC.}},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} {PURPOSE:} Although carcinoembryonic antigen ({CEA)} and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 ({CA} 19-9) are the most studied serum tumor markers that have been evaluated for diagnosis and prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer, little is known of the value of these markers for the prediction of curability and resectability.
{METHODS:} We retrospectively reviewed preoperative serum levels of {CEA} and {CA} 19-9 in 244 consecutive patients with pancreatic operations.
{RESULTS:} Although 159 pancreatic operations seemed "resectable", 93 of them were judged curative (R0) and the other 66 turned out to be noncurative (R1/2). The remaining 85 failed resection because of unexpected metastasis or locally advanced disease ({LD)}, which was unresectable compared with levels in those patients without liver metastasis or {LD.} {CEA} levels were significantly higher in patients with liver metastasis and {LD}, while {CA} 19-9 levels were correlated with liver and peritoneal metastases. When both markers were negative, curative (R0) and respectable (R0 + R1/2) operation were performed in 70\% and 85\% of patients, respectively. Logistic regression analysis indicated that under conditions where both {CEA} and {CA} 19-9 were negative, the odds ratios for curative and respectable operations were 4.43 and 3.58, respectively.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Our data suggest that combined preoperative {CEA} and {CA} 19-9 levels are suitable for assessing expected curability and resectability in patients with pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES:} To determine the sensitivity and specificity of elevated serum {IgG4} level for the diagnosis of autoimmune pancreatitis ({AIP)} and its ability to distinguish {AIP} from pancreatic cancer, its main differential diagnosis.
{METHODS:} We measured serum {IgG4} levels (normal 8-140 {mg/dL)} in 510 patients including 45 with {AIP}, 135 with pancreatic cancer, 62 with no pancreatic disease, and 268 with other pancreatic diseases.
{RESULTS:} Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values for elevated serum {IgG4} ({\textgreater}140 {mg/dL)} for diagnosis of {AIP} were 76\%, 93\%, and 36\%, respectively, and 53\%, 99\%, and 75\%, respectively, for {IgG4} of {\textgreater}280 {mg/dL.} Among subjects with elevated {IgG4}, non-{AIP} subjects (N = 32) differed from {AIP} subjects (N = 34) in that they were more likely to be female (45\%vs 9\%, P {\textless} 0.001), less likely to have serum {IgG4} {\textgreater}280 {mg/dL} (13\%vs 71\%, P {\textless} 0.001), or elevation of total {IgG} (16\%vs 56\%, P {\textless} 0.001).

{CONCLUSION:} Elevated serum {IgG4} levels are characteristic of {AIP.} However, mild ({\textless}2-fold) elevations in serum {IgG4} are seen in up to 10\% of subjects without {AIP} including pancreatic cancer and cannot be used alone to distinguish {AIP} from pancreatic cancer. Because {AIP} is uncommon, {IgG4} elevations in patients with low pretest probability of having {AIP} are likely to represent false positives.},

	abstract = {{CONTEXT:} When assessing the bilio-pancreatic region, collating the findings of serum {CA} 19-9 values together with findings from various imaging tests--especially endoscopic ultrasonography--is not a simple issue in daily clinical practice.
{AIM:} To assess the usefulness of endoscopic ultrasonography in an Endoscopic Ultrasonography Unit in two situations: patients with asymptomatic elevation of serum {CA} 19-9 and patients who presented with abdominal pain plus elevation of {CA} 19-9.
{METHODS:} A retrospective study of those patients who underwent radial endoscopic ultrasonography between October 2004 and September 2005 in our institution, considering an elevation of {CA} 19-9 (equal to or greater than 37 {U/mL)} with or without symptoms. In each case, the parameters recorded were: levels of {CA} 19-9 one week before {EUS}, results from other imaging techniques ({US}, helical {CT)}, and final diagnosis according to pathological and/or clinical evolution criteria. Patients with previous attacks of acute pancreatitis and also those who presented with bile duct dilation or space-occupying lesions in image studies ({US} and {CT)} were excluded. Twenty-two patients met the inclusion criteria.
{RESULTS:} Asymptomatic elevation of {CA} 19-9 was found in 15 patients while 7 patients had elevated {CA} 19-9 levels as well as pain of uncertain origin. The results of {EUS} in the asymptomatic patients were: chronic pancreatitis in 7 patients, no pancreatic alterations in 3 patients, and renal cysts, choledocholithiasis, microlithiasis and liver cirrhosis in one patient, respectively. In patients with abdominal pain, {EUS} showed chronic pancreatitis in 6 cases and adenocarcinoma of the tail of the pancreas in the remaining patient.
{CONCLUSIONS:} When {EUS} was indicated for the asymptomatic elevation of {CA} 19-9, the main findings were benign diseases. {EUS} was useful in studying patients with idiopathic abdominal pain and a slight elevation of {CA} 19-9 since it allowed us to detect chronic pancreatitis and even early adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic tail.},

	doi = {10.1515/CCLM.2007.025},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract and one of the most lethal human cancers. It has been shown that endogenous cytokines, produced aberrantly in many malignancies, including pancreatic cancer, may act as autocrine growth factors or as indicators of the immune response to tumors. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-{CSF)} and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-{CSF)} are hematopoietic growth factors ({HGFs)}, i.e., cytokines that induce proliferation of hematopoietic and cancer cells.
{METHODS:} Serum levels of G-{CSF}, M-{CSF}, carcinoembryonic antigen ({CEA)} and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 ({CA} 19-9) were determined using immunoenzymatic assays in 62 patients with pancreatic cancer before and 30 days after surgery, and in 65 healthy controls.
{RESULTS:} Cancer patients had significantly higher levels of all parameters measured compared to healthy subjects, especially in non-resectable tumors. Higher values of diagnostic parameters [specificity, sensitivity and area under receiver operating characteristic ({ROC)} curve] were observed for M-{CSF} than G-{CSF}, and for combined use of M-{CSF} with {CA} 19-9. Based on Cox analysis, elevated preoperative serum M-{CSF} was a significant prognostic factor for patient survival, although not independent of tumor stage.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Our findings suggest the usefulness of M-{CSF} as a tumor marker for pancreatic cancer, especially in combination with {CA} 19-9.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Pancreatic cancer carries a poor prognosis; at operation approximately 25\% of patients will be found to have unresectable tumours even though {CT} has demonstrated that they are resectable. At our tertiary care centre, we wished to find out if there is an optimum cut-off value for the {CA} 19-9 level preoperatively that will indicate that the pancreatic cancer is unresectable despite radiologic imaging that suggests otherwise according to receiver operating characteristic ({ROC)} curve analysis.
{METHODS:} Preoperative demographic data, clinical features and serum {CA} 19-9 levels were reviewed for 51 patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent laparotomy between 1998 and 2003. Preoperatively, resectability was determined from a complete history, physical examination and radiologic imaging. An {ROC} curve was constructed for the {CA} 19-9 levels. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of {CA} 19-9 were calculated with several cut-off points.
{RESULTS:} There were 18 (36\%) resectable and 33 (64\%) unresectable pancreatic cancers. The mean {CA} 19-9 level was 68.8 {U/mL} in the resectable group and 622 {U/mL} in unresectable group. When a {CA} 19-9 level of 256.4 {U/mL} was used as a cutoff point, the specificity and sensitivity was 92.3\% and 82.4\% respectively.

Multiple statistical methods including receiver operating characteristics curve and discriminant analysis were employed.
{RESULTS:} The established normal range of serum elastase 1 in Chinese adults was found to be under 4.36 {mg/L.} Serum elastase 1 increased markedly in patients with pancreatic carcinoma of smaller size and/or located in the pancreatic head. The sensitivity, specificity and overall accuracy of elastase 1 for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer were 61.5\%, 75.3\% and 71.2\%, respectively, as compared with 71.8\%, 73.1\% and 72.7\% for {CA19-9.} Discriminant analysis can improve the sensitivity and overall accuracy of elastase 1 to 82.0\% and 74.2\%, respectively, with a slight decline in the specificity to 71.0\%.

{METHODS:} An in vitro enzyme immunoassay was established with monoclonal antibody {PAM4} as the capture reagent, and a polyclonal anti-{MUC1} antibody as the probe. Patient sera were obtained from healthy, adult patients with acute and chronic pancreatitis, and those with pancreatic and other forms of cancer, and were measured for {PAM4-reactive} {MUC1.}
{RESULTS:} At a cutoff of 10.2 {units/mL}, 41 (77\%) of 53 pancreatic cancer patients, none of the healthy individuals (n = 43), and only four (5\%) of 87 patients with pancreatitis were positive above this value. Among nonpancreatic cancers investigated, colorectal cancers gave the highest percentage of positives (14\%; five of 36). Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of the immunoassay for pancreatic cancer were 77\% and 95\%, respectively. Receiver operator characteristic analyses for discrimination of pancreatic cancer from pancreatitis provided an area under the curve of 0.89 (95\% {CI}, 0.82 to 0.93), with a specificity of 95.4\% and a positive likelihood ratio of 16.8. A direct pair-wise comparison of {PAM4} and {CA19-9} immunoassays for discrimination of pancreatic cancer and pancreatitis resulted in a significant difference (P {\textless} .003), with the {PAM4} immunoassay demonstrating superior sensitivity and specificity. {CONCLUSION} The high sensitivity and specificity observed suggest that the {PAM4-based} immunoassay of circulating {MUC1} may be useful in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.},

Therefore, serum samples were first chromatographed using an immunoaffinity {HPLC} column (Agilent Technologies), to selectively remove albumin, immunoglobulins, transferrin, haptoglobin, and antitrypsin. Serum samples from three individuals with pancreatic cancer and three individuals without cancer were compared. Serum samples were processed using the immunoaffinity column. Differential protein analysis was performed using {DIGE.} A total of 56 protein spot-features were found to be significantly increased and 43 significantly decreased in cancer serum samples. These spot features were excised, trypsin digested, and analyzed by {MALDI/TOF/TOF} (4700 Proteomics Analyzer, Applied Biosystems). We identified 24 unique proteins that were increased and 17 unique proteins that were decreased in cancer serum samples. Western blot analysis confirmed increased levels of several of these proteins in the pancreatic cancer serum samples. In an independent series of serum samples from 20 patients with pancreatic cancer and 14 controls, increased levels of apolipoprotein E, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor were found to be associated with pancreatic cancer. These results suggest that affinity column enrichment and 2-D {DIGE} can be used to identify numerous proteins differentially expressed in serum from individuals with pancreatic cancer.},

{METHODS:} The data from a prospectively collected database (1997-2004) with 159 patients who had computed tomography-predicted resectable disease and who had undergone laparoscopic staging were analysed to determine if a low preoperative {CA19-9} level ({\textless} or =150 {kU/l}, or {\textless} or =300 {kU/l} with a bilirubin {\textgreater}35 micromol/l) identified patients in whom laparoscopy was not useful.
{RESULTS:} The {CA19-9} level was {\textgreater}150 {kU/l} in 96 patients of whom 75 (78\%) were considered resectable following laparoscopic assessment. There were 63 patients with a {CA19-9} {\textless} or =150 {kU/l} of whom 60 (95\%) were considered resectable following laparoscopic assessment. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for {CA19-9} {\textless} or =150 {kU/l} in predicting that laparoscopic assessment would judge patients as resectable were 44, 88, 95 and 22\%, respectively. A cut-off level of {\textless} or =300 {kU/l} in patients with a bilirubin {\textgreater}35 micromol/l produced values of 30, 94, 94 and 28\%, respectively. By using {CA19-9} {\textless} or =150 {kU/l}, laparoscopy could have been avoided in 40\% of patients, increased to 55\% of patients with adjustment for the presence of jaundice; concomitantly, the yield from laparoscopy would have been increased from 15 to 22 and 25\%, respectively.

{METHODS:} Pre-operative serum {CEA}, {CA19-9} and {CA242} were measured in 105 pancreatic cancers, 70 non-pancreatic malignancies and 30 benign pancreatic diseases.
{RESULTS:} The sensitivity of {CA19-9} alone was the highest in pancreatic cancer patients (80\%), but the specificity was significantly lower than that of {CEA} and {CA242} (P{\textless}0.01). The combination of {CEA} and {CA242} could increase the specificity to 92\%. In serum {CA242} positive patients, the survival time was remarkably shorter than that of patients with negative result (P{\textless}0.01).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Serum levels of {CA19-9} have been shown to correlate with both recurrence and survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. However, little is known about the prognosis for patients with undetectable levels of serum {CA19-9.}
{METHODS:} One hundred twenty-nine patients with pancreatic cancer who underwent preoperative assessment of serum {CA19-9} followed by resection with curative intent between 1990 and 2002 were retrospectively analyzed. Data collected included preoperative serum {CA19-9} level ({U/mL)}, age, pathologic staging, and survival. Data were analyzed with the {SAS} system according to four distinct preoperative serum {CA19-9} levels: undetectable, normal ({\textless}37), 38-200, and {\textgreater}200 {U/mL.}
{RESULTS:} Serum {CA19-9} levels ranged from undetectable to 16,300 {U/mL.} Stage {III/IV} disease accounted for 86\%, 67\%, 59\%, and 53\% of patients in the four {CA19-9} groups. The overall median and 5-year survivals were 19 months and 11\%, respectively. Survival was similar between nonsecretors and those with normal {CA} 19-9 levels. However, both groups had statistically significant prolonged survival compared with the two groups with elevated {CA} 19-9 levels (P =.003). The only factors that were significant on univariate and multivariate analysis for overall survival were lymph node positivity (P =.015 and.002) and {CA} 19-9 grouping (P =.003 and P {\textless}.0001). Although this group of patients presented with predominately advanced-stage disease, their overall survival was superior.
{CONCLUSIONS:} These findings suggest that patients who present with undetectable preoperative {CA19-9} levels and potentially resectable pancreatic cancer, regardless of advanced stage, should be considered candidates for aggressive therapy.},

	abstract = {{AIM:} To establish a method to detect the expression of the tumor specific growth factor {TSGF}, {CA242} and {CA19-9} in serum and evaluate their value in diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} {ELISA} and Biochemical colorimetric assay were used to detect the serum content of {TSGF}, {CA242} and {CA19-9} in 200 normal cases, 52 pancreatitis patients and 96 pancreatic cancer patients.
{RESULTS:} The positive likelihood ratios of {TSGF}, {CA242} and {CA19-9} were 5.4, 12.6 and 6.3, respectively, and their negative likelihood ratios were 0.10, 0.19 and 0.17, respectively. With single tumor marker diagnosed pancreatic cancer, the highest sensitivity and specificity of {TSGF} were 91.6\% and 93.5\%. In combined test with 3 markers, when all of them were positive, the sensitivity changed to 77.0\% and the specificity and the positive predictive value were 100\%. The levels of {TSGF} and {CA242} were significantly higher in the patients with pancreatic cancer of head than those in the patients with pancreatic cancer of body, tail and whole pancreas, but the expression of {CA19-9} had no correlation with the positions of the pancreatic cancer. The sensitivity of {TSGF}, {CA242} and {CA19-9} was increased with the progress in stages of pancreatic cancer. In stage I, the sensitivity of {TSGF} was markedly higher than {CA242} and {CA19-9.}
{CONCLUSION:} The combined use of {TSGF}, {CA242} and {CA19-9} expressions can elevate the specificity for pancreatic cancer diagnosis. And it shows that it plays an important role to differentiate positions and tissue typing. It is a forepart diagnosis for the pancreatic cancer by combination checking. There is very important correlation between the three markers and the pancreatic cancer.},

Unfortunately, many malignant tumors go undetected by the current primary diagnostic tools. {18FDG-PET} and {18FDG-PET/CT} might be useful to confirm suspected pancreatic cancer. {METHODS:} A meta-analysis was performed using all major search engines. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed as well as quality of the {PET-protocol.} The following pooled estimates served as primary outcome measures: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value ({PPV)}, negative predictive value ({NPV)} and accuracy. {RESULTS:} Thirty-five studies were included. Pooled estimates for {18FDG-PET} were: sensitivity 90\%, specificity 76\%, {PPV} 90\%, {NPV} 76\% and accuracy 86\%.

However, the {18FDG-PET/CT} systems are still improving. We should investigate the sensitivity and specificity of these new systems while reevaluating the tradeoff between false positive and false negative results.

{METHODS:} A systematic review of relevant literatures in {PubMed}, Embase and Cochrane Library was performed. The sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic and staging studies, and {HRs} for prognosis predicting studies were pooled. The bivariate model was used for diagnostic studies and the random-effect model for prognostic studies. Heterogeneity between included studies was tested using χ(2) test, and subgroup analysis was performed to explain the heterogeneities. All of the calculations were performed using Stata version 11.0.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The differential diagnosis of solid pancreatic masses has been a significant challenge up until now. {EUS} elastography is now used as a new technique to distinguish benign from malignant pancreatic masses. However, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy are still questionable.
{OBJECTIVE:} To evaluate the accuracy of {EUS} elastography for diagnosis of solid pancreatic masses.
{DESIGN:} Thirteen articles for {EUS} elastography diagnosing solid pancreatic masses were selected. The Mantel-Haenszel and {DerSimonian} Laird methods were used to analyze pooled results.
{SETTING:} Patients: This study involved 1044 patients.
{INTERVENTION:} {EUS} elastography.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} The pooled sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, diagnostic odds ratio, and summary receiver operating characteristic ({sROC)} curve.
{RESULTS:} The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio of {EUS} elastography distinguishing benign from malignant solid pancreatic masses were 0.95 (95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 0.94-0.97), 0.67 (95\% {CI}, 0.61-0.73), and 42.28 (95\% {CI}, 26.90-66.46), respectively. The {sROC} area under the curve was 0.9046.

The addition of {FNA} ({EUS-guided} {FNA)} provides samples for cytopathologic analysis, a major advantage over other imaging techniques.
{OBJECTIVE:} To determine the diagnostic accuracy of {EUS-FNA} for pancreatic cancer.
{DESIGN:} This is a meta-analysis of published studies assessing the diagnostic capability of {EUS-FNA.} Relevant studies were identified via {MEDLINE} and were included if they used a reference standard of definitive surgical histology or clinical follow-up of at least 6 months.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} Data from selected studies were analyzed by using test accuracy meta-analysis software, providing a pooled value for sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, and summary receiver operating characteristic curve. Cytology results were classified as inadequate, benign, atypical, suspicious, or malignant. Predefined subgroup analysis was performed.
{RESULTS:} Thirty-three studies published between 1997 and 2009 were included, with a total number of 4984 patients. The pooled sensitivity for malignant cytology was 85\% (95\% confidence interval [{CI]}, 84-86), and pooled specificity was 98\% (95\% {CI}, 0.97-0.99). If atypical and suspicious cytology results were included to determine true neoplasms, the sensitivity increased to 91\% (95\% {CI}, 90-92); however, the specificity was reduced to 94\% (95\% {CI}, 93-96). The diagnostic accuracy of {EUS-FNA} was enhanced in prospective, multicenter studies.
{LIMITATION:} Publication bias was not a significant determinant of pooled accuracy.
{CONCLUSION:} This meta-analysis demonstrates that {EUS-FNA} is a highly accurate diagnostic test for solid neoplasms of the pancreas and should be considered when algorithms for investigating solid pancreatic lesions are being planned.},

	abstract = {Accurate pretreatment staging of pancreatic cancer is a crucial initial step in the development of a stage-specific treatment plan, either on- or off-protocol for any patient with pancreatic cancer. Importantly, current American Joint Committee on Cancer staging utilizes the maximal information available; if surgery has been performed, then pathological information from the resected specimen will provide additional information for both T and N staging. If surgery has not been performed, then staging is based on information from available cross-sectional imaging studies. Although American Joint Committee on Cancer staging was modified in the sixth edition to reflect the survival difference between patients with operable/resectable versus nonoperable/unresectable disease, the precise definitions of resectability continue to evolve. It is essential for clinicians of different specialties to understand the definitions of resectability to facilitate optimal patient care and to allow for accurate interpretation of the literature. This review focuses on important aspects of the pretreatment assessment of patients with particular attention to definitions of resectability. Computed tomography has become the optimal imaging modality for pancreatic cancer staging, but other adjunct studies, including endoscopic ultrasound and laparoscopy, may provide additional staging information especially in circumstances where computed tomography technology is limited. In addition, the process of a standardized pathological review is summarized, with emphasis on assessment of the superior mesenteric artery margin and the definitions of R0, R1, and R2. Finally, the prognostic importance of key components of the pathological report such as lymph node status, lymph node ratio, and treatment effect is reviewed.},

Compared with surgical findings, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of peripancreatic vascular invasion were 66.67 \%, 100 \%, 100 \%, 60 \%, and 77.78 \%, respectively, for {DCEUS} and 75 \%, 100 \%, 100 \%, 66.67 \%, and 83.33 \%, respectively, for {MDCT.} There was no significant difference in accuracy between {DCEUS} and {MDCT} for evaluating peripancreatic vascular invasion (p = 0.108). The combination of {DCEUS} and {MDCT} increased the diagnostic confidence in assessing peripancreatic vascular invasion with an area under {ROC} curve from 0.83 for {DCEUS} (p = 0.025) and 0.88 for {MDCT} (p = 0.011) to 0.92 for both combined (p = 0.005). The intra- and inter-observer reproducibility were both almost perfect for assessing the peripancreatic vascular invasion by {DCEUS} with a Kappa value of 0.94 (p = 0.000) for intra-observer and 0.83 (p = 0.000) for inter-observer.
{CONCLUSION:} {DCEUS} could be considered as a reliable and accurate method for evaluating the peripancreatic vascular invasion of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.},

{METHODS:} Data were obtained prospectively from patients with a pancreatic lesion who underwent {EUS}, computed tomographic ({CT)} imaging, and surgery from March 2005 to March 2010.
{RESULTS:} Fifty patients were included with a mean ± {SD} age 61 ± 11.5 years; 27 (54\%) were women. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for {EUS} were the following: 61.1 (95\% {CI}, 38.6-79.7), 90.3 (95\% {CI}, 75.1-96.7), 78.6 (95\% {CI}, 52.4-92.4), and 80 (95\% {CI}, 64.1-90), respectively.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Preoperative imaging is often inadequate in excluding unresectable pancreatic cancer. Accordingly, many groups employ staging laparoscopy ({SL)}, although none have evaluated {SL} after preoperative magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI).} We performed a retrospective, indirect cost-effectiveness analysis of {SL} after {MRI} for pancreatic head lesions.
{METHODS:} All {MRI} scans administered for proximal pancreatic cancer between 2004 and 2008 were reviewed and the clinical course of each patient determined. We queried our billing database to render average total costs for all inpatients with proximal pancreatic cancer who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, palliative bypass or an endoscopic stenting procedure. We then performed an indirect evaluation of the cost of routine {SL.}
{RESULTS:} The average costs of hospitalization for patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy, open palliative bypass and endoscopic palliation were: {US\$26}, 122.43, {US\$21}, 957.18 and {US\$11}, 304.00, respectively. The calculated cost of {SL} without laparotomy was {US\$2966.25} or {US\$1538.61} prior to laparotomy. The calculated cost of treating unresectable disease by outpatient laparoscopy followed by endoscopy was {US\$5943.17.} Routine {SL} would increase our costs by {US\$76}, 967.46 (3.6\%).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Staging laparoscopy becomes cost-effective by diverting unresectable patients from operative to endoscopic palliation. Given the paucity of missed metastases on {MRI}, the yield of {SL} is marginal and its cost-effectiveness is poor. Future studies should address the utility of {SL} by both examining this issue prospectively and investigating the cost-effectiveness of endoscopic vs. surgical palliation in a manner that takes account of survival and quality of life data.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} In patients with pancreatic or periampullary tumor, staging laparoscopy ({SL)} can detect metastases that are occult on computed tomography ({CT)}, thereby precluding nontherapeutic laparotomy. Routine {SL} is not advocated, but some studies suggest its selective use. The aim of this study was to identify patients at risk for metastasis in whom {SL} could be beneficial.
{METHODS:} A consecutive series of patients who underwent laparotomy for a suspected pancreatic or periampullary tumor were analyzed. We included patients with a suspected resectable solid lesion and a recent high-quality {CT} scan. Patients with and without an intraoperatively encountered metastasis were compared. Regression analysis was performed to examine the association between various predictors and metastasis.
{RESULTS:} Data from 385 patients (mean age 63, 41\% women) were analyzed. Distant metastasis was encountered in 79 patients (21\%). Logistic regression analysis revealed the following key predictors for metastasis: tumor size on {CT} scan [odds ratio ({OR)} 1.43, 95\% confidence interval ({CI)} 1.16-1.76 per millimeter increase], weight loss ({OR} 1.28, 95\% {CI} 1.01-1.63 per doubling the kilograms), and history of jaundice ({OR} 2.36, 95\% {CI} 0.79-7.06). In patients with a tumor ≥3 cm and severe weight loss (≥10 kg) and in patients with a tumor ≥4 cm and moderate weight loss (≥5 kg), the proportion of patients with metastasis was {\textgreater}40\%.
{CONCLUSIONS:} In patients with a suspected pancreatic or periampullary tumor, the tumor size, weight loss, and jaundice are key predictors of metastasis at exploration. {SL} might be beneficial in patients with a tumor ≥3 cm and severe weight loss and in those with a tumor ≥4 cm and moderate weight loss.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} The aims of this study were to verify whether the selective use of staging laparoscopy can prevent unnecessary laparotomy and to find a surrogate marker for surgical unresectability in patients with potentially or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} Group A consisted of consecutive 33 patients evaluated between 2005 and 2006 and who directly underwent open laparotomy for planned surgical resection. Group B consisted of consecutive 61 patients evaluated between 2007 and 2009 and of whom 16 patients (26\%) had a staging laparoscopy due to the presence of high-risk markers of unresectability defined as carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level 150 {U/mL} or greater and tumor size 30 mm or greater.
{RESULTS:} The frequency of unnecessary laparotomies for occult distant organ metastasis was significantly different between groups A and B (18\% and 3\%, respectively; P = 0.021). Of 16 patients who underwent staging laparoscopy in group B, 5 patients (31\%) had occult metastases. The multivariate analysis showed that the presence of high-risk markers and extrapancreatic plexus invasion on multidetector-row computed tomography were significant independent risk factors for unresectability.
{CONCLUSIONS:} The presence of high-risk markers was associated with surgical unresectability in patients with potentially or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The selective use of staging laparoscopy decreased the frequency of unnecessary laparotomy by detecting minute metastases.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Pancreatic adenocarcinoma impinging the portal and/or superior mesenteric vein ({PV-SMV)} is classified as borderline resectable, and preoperative chemoradiation is recommended to increase the margin-negative resection rate. There is no consensus about what degree of venous impingement constitutes borderline resectability.
{METHODS:} All patients undergoing potentially curative pancreatectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma were reviewed. Venous involvement was classified by preoperative computed tomography according to Ishikawa types: (I) normal, ({II)} smooth shift without narrowing, ({III)} unilateral narrowing, ({IV)} bilateral narrowing, (V) bilateral narrowing with collateral veins.
{RESULTS:} From 1990-2009, 109 patients underwent resection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma involving the {PV-SMV.} Seventy-four patients received preoperative chemoradiation, whereas 35 did not. Patients who received preoperative therapy had a significantly longer median overall survival rate of 23 months compared with 15 months for patients without preoperative therapy (P = 0.001). Preoperative chemoradiation was associated with higher R0 resection rate and negative lymph nodes (both P {\textless} 0.0001) but did not affect the need for vein resection. When stratified by Ishikawa types, preoperative therapy was associated with improved overall survival among patients with types {II} and {III} but not types {IV} and V. Similarly, the correlation between preoperative therapy and R0 resection rate was observed only among patients with Ishikawa types {II} and {III.}
{CONCLUSIONS:} Preoperative therapy for borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma is associated with higher margin-negative resection and survival rates in patients with Ishikawa type {II} and {III} tumors, defined as a smooth shift or unilateral narrowing of the {PV-SMV.} Patients with bilateral venous narrowing were less likely to benefit from preoperative treatment.},

{METHODS:} We prospectively enrolled 104 {CT-resectable} patients with {PAC.} During Step 1 (1995-1999), we performed {LUS} on all patients, whereas during Step 2 (2002-2007), {LUS} was performed selectively according to Pisters' criteria.
{RESULTS:} {LUS} was satisfactorily performed in all cases. At Step 1 accuracy of {LUS} in predicting pancreatic resectability was high (96\%) but it was markedly lower in a subgroup of patients with close contact between tumor and portal vein (sensibility of 57\%). At Step 2, selective {LUS} was performed on 9 of 64 patients (14\%). {LUS} confirmed the {MDCT} finding of unresectability in 8 of 9 cases, and allowed curative resection in 1 case. Only 1 of 55 of the patients who did not undergo {LUS} would have benefited from the procedure. The yield of {LUS} decreased from 45\% before to 1.8\% after {MDCT.}
{CONCLUSIONS:} In resectable-{MDCT} patients, routine {LUS} is unjustified. However, in doubtful {MDCT} cases, {LUS} has yet a good yield. In the event of close vascular contact, neither {MDCT} nor {LUS} seem to be conclusive, and laparotomy is still the only solution.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Preoperative diagnosis of local vascular invasion is very important to the selection of therapeutic protocols and prediction of the prognosis of pancreatic and periampullary cancers. This meta-analysis was designed to evaluate the accuracy of computed tomography ({CT)} in diagnosing vascular invasion in patients with pancreatic and periampullary cancers.
{DATA} {SOURCES:} English-language articles reporting diagnostic accuracy of {CT} for vascular invasion in pancreatic and periampullary cancers were searched from the {MEDLINE} and {PubMed} databases. A meta-analysis was conducted to estimate pooled sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratios.
{RESULTS:} Data were extracted from 18 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of {CT} in diagnosing vascular invasion were 77\% and 81\%. Since {CT} technology improved in different periods, in the recent five years (2004-2008) {CT} has shown a higher diagnostic accuracy, and the pooled sensitivity and specificity increased to 85\% and 82\%, respectively. Subgroup analysis of {CT} studies was made to determine the involvement of different vessels, and the pooled sensitivities for the invasion of the venous system, portal vein, and arterial system were 75\%, 75\%, and 68\%, and the pooled specificities were 84\%, 91\%, and 92\%, respectively. For {CT} imaging with vascular reconstruction, the pooled sensitivity and specificity were 84\% and 85\%, higher than the estimates in studies without reconstruction.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Developed {CT} technology with vascular reconstruction is used as an imaging modality for diagnosing vascular invasion at present. Further combined application of various imaging modalities may improve the accuracy of diagnosis, especially for smaller vessel involvement, such as the superior mesenteric vein or artery, which are difficult to demarcate.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Recent years have brought important developments in preoperative imaging and use of laparoscopic staging of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma ({PAC).} There are few data about the optimal combination of preoperative studies to accurately identify resectable patients.
{STUDY} {DESIGN:} We conducted a statewide review of all patients with surgically managed {PAC} from 1996 to 2003 using data from the Oregon State Cancer Registry, augmented with clinical information from primary medical record review. We documented the use of all staging modalities, including {CT}, endoscopic ultrasonography, and laparoscopy. Primary outcomes included resection with curative intent. The association between staging modalities, clinical features, and resection was measured using a multivariate logistic regression model.
{RESULTS:} There were 298 patients from 24 hospitals who met the eligibility criteria. Patients were staged using a combination of {CT} (98\%), laparoscopy (29\%), and endoscopic ultrasonography (32\%). The overall proportion of patients who went to surgical exploration and were resected was 87\%. Of patients undergoing diagnostic laparoscopy, metastatic disease that precluded resection was discovered in 24 (27.6\%). For patients who underwent diagnostic laparoscopy and were not resected, vascular invasion was the most common determinant of unresectability (56.6\%). In multivariate analysis, preoperative weight loss and surgeon decision to use laparoscopy predicted unresectability at laparotomy.
{CONCLUSIONS:} This population-based study demonstrates that surgeons appear to use laparoscopy in a subset of patients at high risk for metastatic disease. The combination of current staging techniques is associated with a high proportion of resectability for patients taken to surgical exploration. With current imaging modalities, selective application of laparoscopy with a dual-phase {CT} scan as the cornerstone of staging is a sound clinical approach to evaluate pancreatic cancer patients for potential resectability.},

{METHODS:} The contrast-enhancement values were measured by producing the subtracting images for obtaining largest region of interests to reduce measurement errors and variability. Vascularity was determined by immunostaining of the tissue sections with factor 8 and the fibrous stroma was determined by picrosirius staining. Correlation of the findings of {DCE-CT} with pathological findings was performed in 21 patients with pancreatic carcinoma.
{RESULTS:} All but one patient exhibited a gradually increasing enhancement, but there was considerably wide range in contrast-enhancement values of tumors. Examination of the overall relationship between vascularity and fibrous stroma with contrast-enhancement behavior showed that tumor with more fibrosis and higher vascularity had a higher contrast effect through all phases of dynamic study. Tumors having liver metastases tended to be less fibrotic than tumors without liver metastases.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Staging laparoscopy for patients with radiographically resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma has been reported to yield an 8-15\% finding of unresectable disease. Factors associated with the likelihood of subradiographic unresectable disease have not been clearly defined.
{METHODS:} A prospectively maintained pancreatic database was reviewed and patients were identified who underwent staging laparoscopy for radiographically resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma between January 2000 and December 2006. Preoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9 ({CA} 19-9) values were assessed for their association with the presence of subradiographic unresectable disease.
{RESULTS:} Four hundred ninety-one patients underwent staging laparoscopy. Resection was performed in 80\% (n = 395). Of the 96 patients with unresectable disease, 75 (78\%) had metastases either in the liver (n = 60) or peritoneum (n = 15). Preoperative {CA} 19-9 values were available for 262 of the 491 patients. Fifty-one of these patients had unresectable disease, of which 78\% were due to distant disease. The median preoperative {CA} 19-9 value for patients who underwent resection was 131 U/ml versus 379 U/ml for those patients with unresectable disease (P = 0.003). A receiver operating characteristics ({ROC)} curve was developed for preoperative {CA} 19-9 value and tumor resectability. The statistically optimal cutoff value was determined to be 130 U/ml. Unresectable disease was identified in 38 of the 144 patients (26.4\%) with a preoperative {CA} 19-9 {\textgreater}or= 130 U/ml, and in 13 of the 118 patients (11\%) with a {CA} 19-9 {\textless} 130 U/ml (P = 0.003). {CA} 19-9 values greater than 130 U/ml remained a predictor of tumor unresectability on multivariate regression analysis [hazard ratio ({HR)} 2.70, 95\% confidence interval ({CI)} 1.34-5.44; P = 0.005].
{CONCLUSION:} In this study, preoperative {CA} 19-9 values were strongly associated with the identification of subradiographic unresectable disease. Preoperative {CA} 19-9 values may allow surgeons to better select patients for staging laparoscopy.},

	abstract = {Patients with pancreatic cancer continue to have a poor prognosis, with a 5-y survival rate of less than 5\%. Surgery is the only treatment that offers a potential cure. Determining resectability is the principal goal of staging in pancreatic cancer patients. Our objective was to evaluate the value of combined contrast-enhanced ({18)F-FDG} {PET/CT} in assessing the resectability of pancreatic cancer and to compare enhanced {PET/CT} with the performance of {PET} alone and unenhanced {PET/CT.}
{METHODS:} Fifty patients (25 women and 25 men; mean age, 64.3 y; range, 39-84 y) with biopsy-proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma underwent enhanced ({18)F-FDG} {PET/CT} for the evaluation of resectability. Criteria for unresectability were distant metastases, peritoneal carcinomatosis, arterial infiltration, or invasion of neighboring organs other than the duodenum. The performance of enhanced {PET/CT} regarding resectability was compared with that of {PET} alone and unenhanced {PET/CT.} Histology, intraoperative findings, and follow-up {CT} with clinical investigations were used as the reference standard.
{RESULTS:} According to the reference standard, 27 patients had disease that was not resectable because of distant metastases (n=17), peritoneal carcinomatosis (n=5), or local infiltration (n=5). In the assessment of resectability, {PET} alone had a sensitivity of 100\%, specificity of 44\%, accuracy of 70\%, positive predictive value of 61\%, and negative predictive value of 100\%; unenhanced {PET/CT} had respective values of 100\%, 56\%, 76\%, 66\%, and 100\%; and enhanced {PET/CT}, 96\%, 82\%, 88\%, 82\%, and 96\%. In 5 patients, unresectability was missed by all imaging methods and was diagnosed intraoperatively. Enhanced {PET/CT} was significantly superior to {PET} alone (P=0.035), and there was a trend for enhanced {PET/CT} to be superior to unenhanced {PET/CT} (P=0.070).
{CONCLUSION:} The use of enhanced {PET/CT} as a 1-stop-shop imaging protocol for assessing the resectability of pancreatic cancer is feasible and accurate. Enhanced {PET/CT} is significantly superior to {PET} alone.},

Invasion of the surgically relevant vessels was evaluated using a new invasion score. The operative and histological findings and the clinical follow-up served as the gold standard.
{RESULTS:} Forty patients had a pancreatic carcinoma, 5 had metastasis of a different primary tumor, and in 35 patients, there was no malignant pancreatic disease. The sensitivity for tumor detection was 100\%, with a specificity of 88\% for differentiating between malignant and benign pancreatic tumors. Invasion of the surrounding vessels was evaluated correctly using the invasion score, with a sensitivity of 89\% and a specificity of 99\%.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The routine use of staging laparoscopy in patients with radiographically resectable pancreatic and peripancreatic neoplasms remains controversial.
{STUDY} {DESIGN:} We reviewed a prospective database that identified 1,045 patients who underwent staging laparoscopy for radiographically resectable pancreatic or peripancreatic tumors between 1995 and 2005. Radiographic resectability was determined by review of radiographic reports, surgeons' notes, and cross-sectional imaging studies. Factors were assessed for their association with the laparoscopic identification of radiographically occult unresectable disease. Recursive partitioning was used to build a decision tree, with laparoscopic identification of unresectable disease as the outcomes, including only patients since 1999 (modern imaging) and factors available preoperatively.
{RESULTS:} Unresectable disease was identified laparoscopically in 145 of the 1,045 radiographically resectable patients (14\%). Factors associated with radiographically occult unresectable disease included the time period of the study, whether imaging was performed at our institution (internal versus external imaging), primary site, histology, weight loss, and jaundice. Primary site (pancreatic versus nonpancreatic) was identified as the strongest predictor of yield. In patients with nonpancreatic tumors, the yield of laparoscopy was 4\%. In patients with pancreatic tumors, the yield of laparoscopy was 14\% overall, but was 8.4\% in patients with internal imaging versus 17\% in patients with external imaging (p {\textless} 0.01). This higher-risk subgroup was partitioned by the presence of weight loss, then by primary site within the pancreas.
{CONCLUSIONS:} During the time period of this study, the yield of staging laparoscopy decreased and exceeded 10\% only for patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma. When high-quality cross-sectional imaging reveals no evidence of unresectable disease, routine staging laparoscopy may not be warranted for pancreatic or peripancreatic tumors other than presumed pancreatic adenocarcinoma.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} From January 2000 to January 2006, {CT-guided} {CNB} was performed in 80 patients suspected of having pancreatic diseases in the absence of liver metastasis. Biopsies were performed with an 18-20-gauge cutting needle driven by a spring-loaded biopsy gun. Histologic reports and medical records of all patients were retrospectively reviewed. An institutional review board exemption was obtained to perform this retrospective study.
{RESULTS:} All patients tolerated the biopsies well, with no serious complications. Three patients had mild abdominal pain after the procedure, and a limited abdominal {CT} scan did not reveal any marked abnormality. Two patients had an elevated serum amylase level, which returned to normal within 2 weeks. A definitive diagnosis and accurate histologic diagnosis were obtained for 69 patients, for a successful diagnosis rate of 86\%. Surgical sampling was performed in 11 patients with neoplasms and nondiagnostic core-needle biopsies. Only 50\% of patients with well-differentiated adenocarcinomas were definitely diagnosed with {CT-guided} {CNB.}

Herein, we present successful results in laparoscopic pancreas- and spleen-preserving D2 lymph node dissection in advanced upper gastric cancer.
{METHODS:} Between March 2004 and May 2007, 18 clinical T2 patients who underwent {LATG} with D2 lymph node dissection for upper gastric cancer were enrolled.
{RESULTS:} We used the technique of encircling and pulling the splenic artery with umbilical tape and that helped us complete dissection of lymph nodes No. 10 and 11d without distal pancreatectomy or splenectomy. The mean operative time was 370 min without any perioperative complications or conversion to an open procedure.
{CONCLUSIONS:} Laparoscopic extended lymph node dissection without pancreatectomy or splenectomy can be adapted to the patients with clinical T2 upper gastric cancer. The techniques like taping of the splenic artery can be a useful tip for surgeons who wish to perform laparoscopic complete D2 lymph node dissection in advanced upper gastric cancer.},

	abstract = {{PRINCIPLES:} Current methods for detecting vascular invasion in pancreatic cancer can be inaccurate, invasive, and expensive. The aim of this study is to assess the value of current imaging modalities in determining vascular invasion by pancreatic cancer.
{METHODS:} The results of Endoscopic Ultrasonography ({EUS)}, Computed Tomography ({CT)}, Ultrasonography ({US)}, and Angiography performed in 170 patients, suffering from pancreatic cancer, were retrospectively studied and correlated with intra-operative findings and surgical anatomopathological diagnosis after resection. We assessed sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy for detecting vascular invasion.
{RESULTS:} {EUS} turned out to be the most reliable imaging technique for detecting vascular invasion in pancreatic cancer, with a sensitivity of 55\%, specificity of 90\%, positive predictive value of 61.1\%, negative predictive value of 87.5\%, and accuracy of 82.2\%. {CT} results were 39.4\%, 90\%, 52\%, 84.4\%, and 79.1\% for the respective categories, with however, better results with multislice {CT.} The {US} results were 3.7\% for the sensitivity, 96.3\% for the specificity, 25\% for the positive predictive value, 75.2\% for the negative predictive value, and 73.4\% for the accuracy.

{RESULTS:} Data were extracted from 29 studies (N = 1308) that met the inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivity of {EUS} in diagnosing {VI} was 73\% (95\% {CI}, 68.8-76.9) and the pooled specificity was 90.2\% (95\% {CI}, 87.9-92.2). The positive likelihood ratio for diagnosing {VI} by {EUS} was 9.1 (95\% {CI}, 4.6-17.9) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.3 (95\% {CI}, 0.2-0.5).

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Unnecessary laparotomy in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer may both compromise the quality of life and delay the initiation of more appropriate therapy. Very often, peritoneal small liver metastases and true local status cannot be fully determined without surgery. Laparoscopy may spare laparotomy and decrease morbidity for patients with nonresectable advanced disease. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of laparoscopy in patients with potentially resectable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} We reviewed the records of patients undergoing pancreatic surgery at the University of Nebraska Medical Center from October 2001 to April 2005. A total of 59 patients were included in the study. All patients were staged radiographically with a high resolution helical computed tomography scan and their tumors were considered resectable. Thirty-seven patients underwent staging laparoscopy while 22 proceeded directly to laparotomy.
{RESULTS:} Of the 37 patients who underwent laparoscopic staging, 9 (24.3\%) were detected to have metastatic disease or advanced tumor; the remaining 28 (75.7\%) patients with negative laparoscopy proceeded to laparotomy. Of those, 24 patients (85.7\%) underwent pancreatic resection with curative intent, while 4 patients had metastatic or locally advanced disease at subsequent laparotomy which was missed on staging laparoscopy (false negative rate of 14.3\%). Of the 22 patients who proceeded directly to laparotomy, 16 (72.7\%) received curative Whipple resection and 6 (27.3\%) were found to have advanced disease and received bypass procedures or biopsy alone.
{CONCLUSION:} These findings suggest that staging laparoscopy is beneficial in a significant proportion of patients deemed resectable by routine noninvasive preoperative studies. We plan to add intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasound to our staging protocol in order to decrease the false negative rate.},

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Ten patients with pancreatic fluid collections were examined prospectively. Five of the fluid collections were symptomatic pseudocysts and five were pancreatic abscesses. All percutaneous drainages were performed solely under {MR} imaging guidance with a 0.23-T open configuration C-arm shaped {MR} imaging scanner with interventional optical tracking. Every step of the procedure was monitored using balanced fast field echo sequences. In each case, the drainage of the fluid collection was performed with a {MR} imaging-compatible drainage kit using the Seldinger technique. The kit included an 18-gauge needle, a 0.035-inch stiff guide wire, 6-F and 8-F dilators, and an 8-F pigtail drainage catheter.
{RESULTS:} All drainage catheters could successfully be placed into the pancreatic fluid collections under {MR} imaging guidance. Visualization of the needle, dilator, and drainage catheter was excellent. However, visualization of the guide wire was suboptimal. The mean time needed for the {MR-guided} drainage procedure was 44 minutes. No immediate complications occurred. The clinical success rate of the percutaneous drainage was 70\%; three patients were subsequently treated surgically. There were no deaths. The average duration of catheterization was 40 days.

A {CT} grade (O, A-F) of vascular involvement was recorded by a single radiologist. Of 152 patients, who underwent a {LUS}, 56 (37\%) had unresectable disease. Three of 26 (12\%) patients with {CT} grade O, 27 of 88 (31\%) patients with {CT} grade A to D, 17 of 29 (59\%) patients with {CT} grade E and all nine patients with {CT} grade F were found to have unresectable disease. In all, 24\% of patients with tumours {\textless}3 cm were found to have unresectable disease. In those patients with tumours considered unresectable, local vascular involvement was found in 56\% of patients and vascular involvement with metastatic disease in 17\%, while 20\% of patients had liver metastases alone and 5\% had isolated peritoneal metastases. The remaining patient was deemed unfit for resection. Selective use of laparoscopic ultrasound is indicated in the staging of periampullary tumours with {CT} grades A to D.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is a devastating disease that swiftly robs patients of both quality and quantity of life. It is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. In 2003, there were 31,860 reported new cases with 31,270 deaths occurring due to lack of effective therapy. Eighty percent of patients present with either advanced local or metastatic disease. Dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography ({CT)} has become the current staging test of choice. Laparoscopic staging of pancreatic tumors with the addition of ultrasound can reveal intraparenchymal hepatic metastases, small peritoneal metastases, and critical retroperitoneal tumor-vessel relationships approaching the accuracy of open exploration to determine resectability without significantly increasing morbidity or mortality. However, given the current accuracy of high-quality {CT}, the routine use of diagnostic laparoscopy in pancreatic cancer is not warranted. Diagnostic laparoscopy is recommended in select patients with primary tumors greater than 4 cm, tumors in the body or tail of the pancreas, patients with equivocal findings of metastasis on {CT}, ascites, or clinical or laboratory findings suggesting advanced disease such as marked weight loss, hypoalbuminemia, and elevated {CA} 19-9.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE:} To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)} for preoperative staging in pancreatic carcinoma.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} {MRI} investigations, including {MR-angio} and {MR-cholangiopancreatography} ({MRCP)} of 19 patients who underwent surgery for pancreatic carcinoma were retrospectively evaluated by two radiologists. The size, localization of the tumor and possible infiltration of neighboring organs, as well as the presence of enlarged lymph nodes, were determined to define a preoperative, radiological {TN} stage. Lymph node metastasis was defined as peripancreatic lymphoma greater than 10 mm. Our findings were correlated to postoperative diagnosis.
{RESULTS:} The T-stage was correctly evaluated in 52.6\% of the cases (10/19). Understaging took place in 31.6\% (6/19) and overstaging in 15.8\% (3/19). In three cases of understaging, a micro-infiltration of the peripancreatic tissue was not visible in {MRI.} Pathologically enlarged lymph nodes were correctly found in 63.2\% of the cases (12/19). Overstaging took place in 21.1\% of the cases (4/19) and understaging in 15.8\% (3/19).
{CONCLUSION:} {MRl} for preoperative staging of pancreatic carcinoma showed a tendency to understage tumor size in this study population. Especially in cases of small tumor size, micro-infiltration of peripancreatic tissue or the common bile duct may not be detected by {MRI.} Concerning N-stage, the 95\% confidence interval reveals a distribution of over- and understaged.},

	abstract = {Pancreas cancer is the fourth leading cancer killer in adults. Cure of pancreas cancer is dependent on the complete surgical removal of localized tumor. A complete surgical resection is dependent on accurate preoperative and intra-operative imaging of tumor and its relationship to vital structures. Imaging of pancreatic tumors preoperatively and intra-operatively is achieved by pancreatic protocol computed tomography ({CT)}, endoscopic ultrasound ({EUS)}, laparoscopic ultrasound ({LUS)}, and intra-operative ultrasound ({IOUS).} Multi-detector {CT} with three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of images is the most useful preoperative modality to assess resectability. It has a sensitivity and specificity of 90 and 99\%, respectively. It is not observer dependent. The images predict operative findings. {EUS} and {LUS} have sensitivities of 77 and 78\%, respectively. They both have a very high specificity. Further, {EUS} has the ability to biopsy tumor and obtain a definitive tissue diagnosis. {IOUS} is a very sensitive (93\%) method to assess tumor resectability during surgery. It adds little time and no morbidity to the operation. It greatly facilitates the intra-operative decision-making. In reality, each of these methods adds some information to help in determining the extent of tumor and the surgeon's ability to remove it. We rely on pancreatic protocol {CT} with 3-D reconstruction and either {EUS} or {IOUS} depending on the tumor location and operability of the tumor and patient. With these modern imaging modalities, it is now possible to avoid major operations that only determine an inoperable tumor. With proper preoperative selection, surgery is able to remove tumor in the majority of patients.},

{RESULTS:} In a consecutive series of 59 patients screened by {MRI}, {PET}, {EUS} and {LAP} between July 1998 and November 2002, 48 patients were found to bear pancreatic adenocarcinoma and surgery was performed in 27 of them. For tumor detection, the sensitivity of {EUS} was superior to {MRI} and {PET} (98 vs. 87.5 and 87.5\%, respectively, p = 0.13). {MRI} best assessed loco-regional staging, i.e. arterial involvement. For the detection of distant metastases, the sensitivity of all preoperative examinations taken separately was low. When laparotomy was performed with a curative intent according to all four examinations, occult metastasis or carcinomatosis was discovered in 7/27 patients and the overall predictive value of resectability was thus 74\%. Five-year and median survival were significantly better in resected vs. non-resected patients (39\% and 26 months vs. 0\% and 8 months, p = 0.0006).

This study aimed to evaluate additional staging information obtained by laparoscopy in the subset of patients with locally extending pancreatic cancer but no evidence of distant disease using computed tomography.
{METHODS:} Between April 2000 and February 2004, 74 patients with locally unresectable pancreatic cancer and no evidence of metastasis detected by high-quality pancreas protocol computed tomography underwent outpatient staging laparoscopy and peritoneal lavage cytology.
{RESULTS:} Occult tumor was found during staging laparoscopy in 25 of the 74 patients (34\%). The results were positive for peritoneal lavage cytology in 27\% (20/74), for liver lesions in 16\% (12/74), and for peritoneal implants in 7\% (5/74) of the patients. Body and tail tumors were twice as likely as pancreatic head tumors to have unsuspected metastasis (53\% vs 28\%).

	doi = {10.1007/s00464-004-8712-5},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} We hypothesized that the high-quality images from multidetector-row computed tomography ({MDCT)} would lead to improved sensitivity and specificity for predicting resectable pancreatic head adenocarcinoma, thus diminishing the value of staging laparoscopy.
{METHODS:} Forty four consecutive patients underwent thin-section dual-phase {MDCT} to stage their tumor, followed by an attempted pancreaticoduodenectomy. Four radiologists who were blinded to the operative outcome reviewed the scans and graded the presence of distant and nodal metastases, as well as the degree of arterial and portal involvement. The radiologic criteria for resectability were no distant metastasis, a patent portal vein, and {\textless} 50\% arterial involvement.
{RESULTS:} The overall resectability for this cohort was 52\% (23/44). The 21 unresectable cases, included five liver metastases, three peritoneal metastases, and 13 locally invasive tumors. The negative margin resection rate was 34\% (15/44). There were no portal vein resections. The sensitivity and specificity of {MDCT} for predicting resectability were 96\% (22/23) and 33\% (7/21), respectively. In this cohort, the positive and negative predictive values were 61\% (22/36) and 87.5\% (7/8), respectively. As determined by univariate logistic regression, only the degree of arterial involvement was a significant predictor of resectability (p = 0.02). As determined by multivariate logistic regression using both arterial and portal involvement, arterial involvement was predictive (p = 0.03) but portal vein involvement was not (p = 0.45).
{CONCLUSIONS:} Despite the improvements in image quality obtained with multidetector-row technology, {CT} imaging remains a relatively nonspecific test for predicting resectability in patients with adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas. Minimally invasive modalities with higher specificity, particularly laparoscopy, continue to have an important role in staging pancreatic head adenocarcinoma.},

Patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer are considered candidates for novel treatment protocols. Stratification of patients into locally advanced disease versus metastatic disease is imperative to accurately evaluate treatment outcome. Between 1994 and 2000, 100 consecutive patients undergoing staging laparoscopy with radiologic evidence of unresectable locally advanced pancreatic cancer were identified from a prospective database. All patients had preoperative contrast-enhanced, thin-cut computed tomography scanning or magnetic resonance imaging and had no evidence of detectable metastatic disease. There were 53 men and 47 women, with a median age of 64 years. The disease site was the pancreatic head in 69 cases and the body or tail in 31. Radiographic assessment of nonresectability was due to encasement of the celiac or hepatic artery in 37 patients, of the portal vein and superior mesenteric vessels in 56, and extrapancreatic extension in 7. Laparoscopy identified metastatic disease in 37\% of patients, not seen on preoperative imaging. Peritoneal disease was noted in 12 cases and liver metastasis in 18 cases, and 7 patients had both. Neither the primary tumor size nor location influenced the incidence of metastatic disease. Standard imaging modalities failed to detect metastatic disease in 37\% of patients who were considered to have locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Patients considered for treatment protocols for locally unresectable pancreatic cancer should be staged laparoscopically before initiation of therapy.},

{RESULTS:} Masses were safely accessed with a direct (noncoaxial) pathway traversing the {IVC} (n = 54), renal vein (n = 4), or both (n = 3). Overall diagnostic accuracy was 86\% (50 of 58). Cytologic examination was positive for malignancy in 39 of 58 biopsies (67\%). Benign lesions were demonstrated in 12 of 58 biopsies. In seven cases (12\%), the sample was deemed nondiagnostic.

Sixty-six of the 305 patients did not undergo {LA}, of whom 23 underwent resection.
{CONCLUSION:} When added to dual-phase helical {CT}, laparoscopy with laparoscopic ultrasound provides valuable information that significantly improves the selection of patients for surgical or non-surgical treatment.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} The interest of laparoscopy in the preoperative staging of pancreatic head adenocarcinoma before curative pancreaticoduodenectomy is a matter of controversy and depends on the accuracy of preoperative imaging techniques.
{AIM:} To assess the potential value of laparoscopy when a standardised and optimal preoperative staging is performed, including spiral computed tomography ({CT)} and endoscopic ultrasonography ({EUS).}
{METHODS:} All consecutive patients operated on with a view to curative pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic head or ampullary adenocarcinoma in our centre from January 1998 to August 2000 were retrospectively studied. All of them had preoperative spiral {CT} and {EUS.} Tumour resectability was considered as highly probable ({HP)} or uncertain (U) according to well-defined criteria. Operative records of patients were reviewed to indirectly assess the effective resectability rate and the criteria responsible for unresectability and which of them would have been identified by laparoscopy if initially performed.
{RESULTS:} 69 consecutive patients were studied. Resectability was {HP} (n = 56) or U (n = 13) after preoperative staging. Curative pancreatoduodenectomy was performed in 53 patients (77\%) (48 {HP}, 5 U). Positive predictive value of preoperative imaging for highly probable resectability was 86\% (48/56). Among the 16 unresectable tumours (8 {HP}, 8 U), the cause of non-resection would have been found at laparoscopy in 9 patients (56\%) (6 {HP}, 3 U). Finally, if initially performed, laparoscopy would have avoided laparotomy in 9/69 patients (13\%) (6/56 {HP} (11\%); 3/13 U (23\%)).
{CONCLUSIONS:} With accurate preoperative staging using spiral {CT} and {EUS}, laparoscopy would detect tumours which were unresectable in 13\% of patients with pancreatic head cancer. Laparoscopy remains useful in selected patients, such as those with preoperative uncertain resectability, in whom it can prevent unnecessary laparotomy in one fourth of patients.},

Regarding the {CT} criterion circumferential involvement, vascular invasion was demonstrated on axial {MPRs} with a sensitivity and specificity of 58 and 97\%. For the assessment with coronal and sagittal {MPRs} sensitivity was only 47\%. Vascular invasion was recognized best on perpendicular {MPRs} with a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 74, 97 and 88\%, respectively. Vessel narrowing was a less reliable {CT} criterion for vascular invasion, mainly due to the lower specificity of 91\% obtained with each available {MPR.} Thin-slice {MPRs} oriented perpendicularly to a possibly invaded vessel exactly depict the grade of circumferential involvement and thus have the capability to improve the assessment of vascular invasion in pancreatic cancer.},

{OBJECTIVE:} The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence of fatty pancreas and risk factors associated with its development.
{DESIGN:} Prospective, single center study.
{SETTING:} Tertiary-care academic medical center.
{PATIENTS:} This study involved 250 consecutive patients referred for {EUS} examination.
{INTERVENTION:} All patients undergoing {EUS} at our institution were prospectively identified. Information regarding demographics, tobacco use, alcohol use, blood test results, and comorbidities were collected before {EUS.} Pancreatic echogenicity was graded in comparison to the spleen at the time of {EUS} by using an a priori specified grading scheme.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} Prevalence of fatty pancreas and factors associated with its development.
{RESULTS:} During the study period, 250 consecutive patients were prospectively enrolled. The prevalence of fatty pancreas was 27.8\% (95\% {CI}, 22.1-34.1). Fatty liver was seen in 22.6\% of patients. Factors associated with fatty pancreas on univariate analysis were increasing body mass index ({BMI)} (P=.004), fatty liver (P{\textless}.0001), hyperlipidemia (P=.04), and the metabolic syndrome (odds ratio [{OR]} 3.13, P=.004). The presence of any metabolic syndrome components, that is, {BMI≥30}, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or hypertension, increased the prevalence of fatty pancreas by 37\% ({OR} 1.37, P=.01). Factors independently associated with fatty pancreas on multivariate analysis were increasing {BMI} ({OR} 1.05, P=.03) and fatty liver ({OR} 3.61, P{\textless}.001).

However, data about {CT} features of colloid carcinoma are very limited. This study aimed to investigate the {CT} features of this tumor.
{METHODS:} Institutional review board approval was obtained for this study. Seven patients with pathologically proven colloid carcinoma of the pancreas were included. Unenhanced and dynamic enhanced {CT} was performed in all the patients. {CT} features were analyzed retrospectively and correlations with pathological findings were evaluated.
{RESULTS:} Mean age of the patients was 59.8 years (41 - 76 years). Five tumors were located in the pancreatic head, and the other two in body and tail respectively. The maximum mean diameter of the tumors on axial scanning was 3.9 cm (3.0 - 6.7 cm). Tumors were round (n = 5) and lobular (n = 2). Tumors appeared slight hyp-attenuation on unenhanced {CT}, and peripheral and internal meshlike progressive delayed enhancement with great percent of cystic areas on enhanced {CT.} Calcification and gas in the tumor was seen in one patient whose duodenum was invaded by the tumor.

	abstract = {{PURPOSE:} The aim of this study is to retrospectively analyze the variety of {CT} findings based on new pathologic classification.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} During a 10-year period, 59 histopathologically proven pancreatic {SCTs} and 13 {SCTs} confirmed with typical image findings and strict clinical criteria were enlisted. Two radiologists analyzed {CT} images for the following items in consensus: location, size, outer margin, tumor shape, the presence of mural nodule, communication with main pancreatic duct ({MPD)}, the presence and extent of {MPD} dilatation, calcification, central scar, and attenuation on pre- and post-contrast {CT} images. In addition, typicality of {CT} findings was determined. A typical finding was defined as a honeycomb appearance without or with oligocystic portion. In the cases with atypical features, the type of atypical features and differential diagnosis were recorded. For the shape of the tumor, tumors were categorized into the following groups: honeycomb without or with oligocystic, pleomorphic, purely oligolocular, unilocular cystic, hypovascular solid, hypervascular solid without or with oligocystic portion, and fingerlike cystic patterns.
{RESULTS:} 28 {SCTs} (38.9\%) presented a honeycomb appearance with (n=14) or without oligocystic portion (n=14) and were classified as typical cases. The remaining 44 atypical cases (61.1\%) presented the following: purely oligolocular pattern in 18; hypervascular solid without (n=7) or with oligocystic portion (n=2) in 9; pleomorphic in 8; unilocular cystic in 7; and fingerlike cystic pattern in 2. Most of the lesions manifesting as hypervascular solid lesions were confused with true solid hypervascular tumors such as neuroendocrine tumors or solid pseudopapillary tumors. For most of the remaining atypical lesions, mucinous cystic neoplasm or branch duct type {IPMN} were included as a differential diagnosis.
{CONCLUSION:} Serous cystic tumors of the pancreas can have variable {CT} appearances ranging from compactly solid hypervascular to clearly unilocular cystic, which reflect a varied macroscopic morphology. Only 38.9\% of the {SCTs} show traditional typical {CT} features whereas a considerable proportion (61.1\%) of {SCTs} showed atypical appearances, providing diagnostic challenges to radiologists.},

{PATIENTS:} A total of 104 patients undergoing standard {EUS} examinations.
{INTERVENTIONS:} Contrast-enhanced harmonic {EUS} ({CEH-EUS)} was performed by using a prototype echoendoscope and extended pure harmonic detection mode, a specific mode for contrast harmonic imaging.
{MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASUREMENTS:} In study I, time-intensity curves for peak signal intensity were calculated after infusion of a contrast agent, {SonoVue}, and the changes in echo intensity were compared for different mechanical indices and interval times. In study {II}, intermittent and real-time continuous images of pancreatobiliary and gastroduodenal diseases obtained by {CEH-EUS} were evaluated in comparison with contrast-enhanced power-Doppler {EUS} ({CED-EUS).}
{RESULTS:} In study I, with the optimal mechanical index (0.4), homogeneous parenchymal perfusion images of the pancreas were obtained by intermittent imaging, and finely branching vessels of the pancreas were obtained with real-time continuous imaging. In study {II}, apparent perfusion and vessel images were observed in pancreatobiliary carcinomas, {GI} stromal tumors, and lymph-node metastases. {CED-EUS} failed to depict images of the fine vessels and parenchymal perfusion.

Two radiologists evaluated imaging studies and determined, by consensus, the following data for each tumor: size, location, margination, internal density or signal intensity, and contrast enhancement pattern. In addition, they assessed the presence of calcification, pancreatic or bile duct dilation, and metastases. Imaging features were correlated with gross and microscopic pathologic features of the tumors.
{RESULTS:} Masses were distributed throughout the pancreas (head, n=5; body, n=2; and tail, n=4). The mean largest dimensions were 6.0 x 5.3 cm (range, from 2 x 1.7 to 15 x 11 cm). Tumors were oval (n=5), round (n=4), or lobular (n=2). Ten (91\%) masses were well marginated; nine (82\%) were exophytic. Five (45\%) masses enhanced homogeneously; the remaining tumors contained cystic areas. All masses enhanced less than the surrounding pancreas. Three (27\%) masses contained calcifications. Four (80\%) masses invaded the duodenum. Common bile and pancreatic duct dilatation was present in two and three patients, respectively. One patient had metastatic liver disease at presentation.

	abstract = {A synergy of positron emission tomography ({PET)/computed} tomography ({CT)} scanners is the use of the {CT} data for x-ray-based attenuation correction of the {PET} emission data. Current methods of measuring transmission use positron sources, gamma-ray sources, or x-ray sources. Each of the types of transmission scans involves different trade-offs of noise versus bias, with positron transmission scans having the highest noise but lowest bias, whereas x-ray scans have negligible noise but the potential for increased quantitative errors. The use of x-ray-based attenuation correction, however, has other advantages, including a lack of bias introduced from post-injection transmission scanning, which is an important practical consideration for clinical scanners, as well as reduced scan times. The sensitivity of x-ray-based attenuation correction to artifacts and quantitative errors depends on the method of translating the {CT} image from the effective x-ray energy of approximately 70 {keV} to attenuation coefficients at the {PET} energy of 511 {keV.} These translation methods are usually based on segmentation and/or scaling techniques. Errors in the {PET} emission image arise from positional mismatches caused by patient motion or respiration differences between the {PET} and {CT} scans; incorrect calculation of attenuation coefficients for {CT} contrast agents or metallic implants; or keeping the patient's arms in the field of view, which leads to truncation and/or beam-hardening (or x-ray scatter) artifacts. Proper interpretation of {PET} emission images corrected for attenuation by using the {CT} image relies on an understanding of the potential artifacts. In cases where an artifact or bias is suspected, careful inspection of all three available images ({CT} and {PET} emission with and without attenuation correction) is recommended.},

Таким образом, использования мультиспиральной КТ и МРТ с болюсным контрастированием не только повышает выявляемость рака поджелудочной железы, но и позволяет оценить резектабельность процесса.},
