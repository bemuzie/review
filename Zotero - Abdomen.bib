abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of equipment and contrast agents for ultrasound imaging has contributed to major breakthroughs in the diagnosis of pancreatic tumors. We aimed to determine the diagnostic effectiveness of contrast ultrasound with Levovist, using the Agent Detection Imaging (ADI) technique, in 50 patients with pancreatic tumors.
METHODS: We studied 50 cases of histologically proven pancreatic disease; 39 carcinomas, 2 endocrine tumors, 4 intraductal papillary mucinous carcinomas (IPMCs), and 5 cases of tumor-forming pancreatitis (TFP). Vascular and perfusion images of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CE-US) were used for the evaluation of tumor vascularity and parenchymal perfusion of the tumor, respectively. The hemodynamics of the tumor, and the diagnostic capacity of CE-US were compared with those shown by computed tomography (CT). The histological diagnosis in all cases was made from either biopsy or surgical specimens.
RESULTS: Thirty-four cases of pancreatic carcinoma (87\%) showed a hypovascular and hypoperfusion pattern. The endocrine tumors showed a heterogeneous hypervascular and hyperperfusion pattern. All IPMC cases showed hypervascularity of the nodules inside the tumors. TFP showed an isovascular and homogeneous isoperfusion pattern. When tumors showing a hypovascular or hypoperfusion pattern on CE-US were diagnosed as carcinomas, 34 of the 39 carcinomas (87\%) fit this criterion, with a 95\% confidence interval (CI) of 73\%-96\%, whereas, on CT, 31 of the 39 were diagnosed as carcinoma; (sensitivity, 79\%). The sensitivity and accuracy of CT were inferior to those of CE-US. Results of comparison between the CE-US findings and the histological diagnosis were as follows. The one papillary adenocarcinoma showed a hypervascular and hyperperfusion pattern; the 32 well or moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas showed a hypovascular and hypoperfusion pattern; and in the poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas, 2 cases of scirrhous type showed a hypovascular and hypoperfusion pattern, and the 4 cases of medullary type showed an isovascular and isoperfusion pattern.
CONCLUSIONS: The differences in vascularity of pancreatic carcinomas depicted by CE-US were associated well with differences in histology. CE-US, by the ADI technique, is useful for the diagnosis of pancreatic tumors.},

abstract = {Familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) describes families with at least two first-degree relatives with confirmed exocrine pancreatic cancer that do not fulfil the criteria of other inherited tumour syndromes with increased risks of pancreatic cancer, such as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, hereditary pancreatitis, and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. The inheritance of FPC is mostly autosomal dominant and with a heterogeneous phenotype. The major gene defect is yet to be identified, although germline mutations in BRCA2, PALB2 and ATM are causative in some FPC families. Expert consensus conferences considered it appropriate to screen for pancreatic cancer in high-risk individuals using a multidisciplinary approach under research protocol conditions. However, neither biomarkers nor reliable imaging modalities for the detection of high-grade precursor lesions are yet available. Most screening programmes are currently based on findings from endoscopic ultrasonography and MRI, and data has demonstrated that precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer can be identified. No consensus exists regarding the age to initiate or stop screening and the optimal intervals for follow-up. Timing and extent of surgery as a treatment for FPC are debated. This Review focuses on the clinical phenotype of FPC, its histopathological characteristics, known underlying genetic changes and associated genetic counselling and screening.},

abstract = {X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been used for diagnoses of human pancreatic cancer. Although micro-CT is a useful approach to evaluate macromorphology of organs/tissue also in animal models, reports on pancreatic tumors are limited. In this study, the utility of micro-CT was assessed in characterizing chemically induced pancreatic tumors in Syrian hamsters. Hamsters treated with or without N-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine (BOP) were injected with the antispasmodic agent, scopolamine butylbromide, and contrast agents, 5 or 10 mL/kg body weight of iopamidol or Fenestra VC at 18-38 weeks, then examined by micro-CT scanning with a respiratory gating system. Both peristaltic and respiratory movements were substantially suppressed by the combination of scopolamine butylbromide treatment and the respiratory gating system, resulting in improvements of image qualities. Iopamidol clearly visualized the pancreatic parenchyma and contrasted the margins among the pancreas and other abdominal organs/tissue. Meanwhile Fenestra VC predominantly contrasted abdominal vascular systems, but the margins among pancreas and other organs/tissue remained obscure. Six pancreatic tumors of 4-13 mm in diameter were detected in four of 15 animals, but not the five tumors of 1-4 mm in diameter. The inner tumor images were heterogeneously or uniformly visualized by iopamidol and Fenestra VC. Overall, iopamidol could clearly contrast between pancreatic parenchyma and the tumors as compared with Fenestra VC. All tumors confirmed were histopathologically diagnosed as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas. Thus, micro-CT could be useful to evaluate the carcinogenic processes and preventive methods of pancreatic cancer in hamsters and to assess the novel contrast agents for detection of small pancreatic cancer in humans.},

abstract = {Autoimmune pancreatitis (\{AIP)\} is a newly described entity of pancreatitis in which the pathogenesis appears to involve autoimmune mechanisms. Based on histological and immunohistochemical examinations of various organs of \{AIP\} patients, \{AIP\} appears to be a pancreatic lesion reflecting a systemic \{"IgG4-related\} sclerosing disease". Clinically, \{AIP\} patients and patients with pancreatic cancer share many features, such as preponderance of elderly males, frequent initial symptom of painless jaundice, development of new-onset diabetes mellitus, and elevated levels of serum tumor markers. It is of uppermost importance not to misdiagnose \{AIP\} as pancreatic cancer. Since there is currently no diagnostic serological marker for \{AIP\}, and approach to the pancreas for histological examination is generally difficult, \{AIP\} is diagnosed using a combination of clinical, serological, morphological, and histopathological features. Findings suggesting \{AIP\} rather than pancreatic cancer include: fluctuating obstructive jaundice; elevated serum \{IgG4\} levels; diffuse enlargement of the pancreas; delayed enhancement of the enlarged pancreas and presence of a capsule-like rim on dynamic computed tomography; low apparent diffusion coefficient values on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance image; irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; less upstream dilatation of the main pancreatic duct on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography, presence of other organ involvement such as bilateral salivary gland swelling, retroperitoneal fibrosis and hilar or intrahepatic sclerosing cholangitis; negative work-up for malignancy including endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration; and steroid responsiveness. Since \{AIP\} responds dramatically to steroid therapy, accurate diagnosis of \{AIP\} can avoid unnecessary laparotomy or pancreatic resection.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES We investigated the clinical and radiological features of focal mass-forming autoimmune pancreatitis (FMF AIP) to help physicians avoid performing unnecessary surgery because of an improper diagnosis. METHODS We evaluated 23 patients with chronic inflammatory pancreatic masses and who underwent pancreatectomy for presumed pancreatic cancer from April 1995 to December 2005. These patients were distinguished into 8 FMF AIP patients and 15 ordinary chronic pancreatitis patients through a histological review, along with considering the immunoglobulin G4 staining. Twenty-six randomly selected pancreatic cancer patients were also evaluated as a control group. RESULTS On the portal venous phase of computed tomography, 6 (85.7\%) of 7 FMF AIP patients showed homogeneous enhancement, whereas only 3 chronic pancreatitis patients (25\%) and none of the pancreatic cancer patients showed homogeneous enhancement (P < 0.001). None of the FMF AIP patients showed upstream main pancreatic duct dilatation greater than 5 mm or proximal pancreatic atrophy. CONCLUSIONS For patients with a pancreatic mass, if their radiological images show homogeneous enhancement on the portal venous phase, the absence of significant upstream main pancreatic duct dilatation greater than 5 mm, and the absence of proximal pancreatic atrophy, then conducting further evaluations should be considered to avoid performing unnecessary surgery.},

abstract = {The strength of functional imaging lies in its ability to detect malignant disease irrespective of lesion morphology. In this setting, 18FDG-PET can complement management by providing a more accurate diagnosis. When combined as an adjunct to CT, 18FDG-PET can increase the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for detecting a pancreatic malignancy, especially in patients in whom CT alone fails to identify a discrete mass or in whom biopsy results are indeterminate. This capability is accentuated with small lesions of the pancreas. 18FDG-PET is significantly more sensitive in detecting metastatic disease than conventional CT imaging. Moreover, 18FDG-PET is able to differentiate tumor response to therapy in the postoperative setting, and could potentially serve to monitor recurrence patterns in the setting of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Finally, as 18FDG-PET/CT fusion modalities become more widespread and technical advances in image acquisition progress, 18FDG-PET will continue to have an increasing role in the diagnosis, staging, and surveillance of pancreatic cancer, integrating anatomic information with functional imaging.},

abstract = {Background: Coded phase inversion harmonic ultrasonography, a newly available sonographic technique, enables visualisation of slow flow in minute vessels in a real time fashion with the use of a sonographic contrast agent containing monosaccharide. Our purpose was to employ this novel technique to observe microvessels in pancreatic tumours.  Subjects and methods: Sixty five patients with suspicious pancreatic tumours received contrast enhanced coded phase inversion harmonic ultrasonography, contrast enhanced computed tomography, and endosonography. Final diagnoses based on histological findings were pancreatic ductal carcinomas in 49 patients, inflammatory pseudotumours with chronic pancreatitis in seven, and endocrine tumours in nine. For contrast enhanced coded harmonic ultrasonography, Levovist, a contrast agent, was injected intravenously as a bolus. When the first microbubble signal appeared in the pancreas, images of the ideal scanning plane were displayed in a real time continuous fashion (vessel images). Subsequently, interval delay scanning (perfusion images) was taken to demonstrate parenchymal flow. Tumour vascularity was evaluated by using the two types of imaging. Sensitivities for depicting pancreatic tumours were compared between three examinations.  Results: Contrast enhanced ultrasonography demonstrated tumour vessels in 67\% of pancreatic ductal carcinomas, although most were relatively hypovascular compared with the surrounding pancreatic tissue. The vascular patterns of tumours obtained by contrast enhanced ultrasonography were closely correlated with those obtained by contrast enhanced computed tomography. Values for sensitivity in depicting pancreatic tumours of 2 cm or less in size were 68\% for contrast enhanced computed tomography, 95\% for endosonography, and 95\% for contrast enhanced ultrasonography.  Conclusion: Contrast enhanced coded phase inversion harmonic ultrasonography successfully visualised fine vessels in pancreatic tumours and may play a pivotal role in the depiction and differential diagnosis of pancreatic tumours.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the frequency of isoattenuating pancreatic adenocarcinoma with multi–detector row computed tomography (CT) and determine whether there are specific secondary signs that aid in detection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-three patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma underwent contrast material–enhanced biphasic multi–detector row CT with curved planar reformation. Tumors were initially deemed isoattenuating or hypoattenuating to normal pancreatic parenchyma on the basis of visual inspection, and the degree of attenuation was confirmed by calculating the mean attenuation differences between normal pancreatic parenchyma and tumor (tumor-pancreas contrast) during the pancreatic phase. Indirect signs of pancreatic tumor were tabulated in patients with an isoattenuating tumor.
RESULTS: Of the 53 patients, six (11\%) had isoattenuating tumors with a mean tumor-pancreas contrast of 9.25 HU ± 11.3 during the pancreatic phase and 4.15 HU ± 8.5 during the portal venous phase. The secondary signs of pancreatic tumor in these six patients included an interrupted pancreatic duct (n = 5), dilated biliary and pancreatic ducts (n = 1), atrophic distal pancreatic parenchyma (n = 3), and mass effect and/or convex contour abnormality (n = 3). The mean tumor-pancreas contrast for the remaining 47 patients was 74.76 HU ± 35.61 during the pancreatic phase.
CONCLUSION: With no visible tumor-pancreas contrast for isoattenuating tumors, indirect signs such as mass effect, atrophic distal parenchyma, and an interrupted duct sign are important indicators for the presence of tumor.},

Technological advances in cross-sectional and endoscopic imaging modalities offer pancreatic imaging options with degrees of resolution that were not available even 15-20 years ago. In most cases, the nature of a solid pancreatic mass can be determined using computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and endoscopic ultrasound with fine-needle aspiration. Knowledge about the basics of these modalities, as well as their strengths and limitations, plays an important role in understanding how patients with solid pancreatic masses should be evaluated.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) elastography is a novel method for visualization of tissue elasticity modulus during a conventional EUS examination. The reported yield of EUS elastography for the differentiation of benign and malignant pancreatic masses has shown variable results. The objective of this study was to assess the accuracy of EUS elastography by pooling data of available trials.
METHODS: The Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Trials databases were used to retrieve all the studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of EUS elastography for the differentiation of benign and malignant pancreatic masses. Pooling was carried out using a fixed-effect model when significant heterogeneity was not present; otherwise, the random-effect model was used. If there were less than four studies using the same diagnostic standard, forest plots were constructed without pooling.
RESULTS: In six studies using the qualitative color pattern as the diagnostic standard, the sensitivity was 99\% (95\% confidence interval 98-100\%) and the specificity was 74\% (95\% confidence interval 65-82\%). The area under the curve under the summary receiver-operating characteristic was 0.9624. In three studies using the quantitative hue histogram value as the diagnostic standard, the sensitivity was 85-93\% and the specificity was 64-76\%.
CONCLUSION: EUS elastography is a promising noninvasive technique for the differentiation of pancreatic masses with a high sensitivity, and may prove to be a valuable complementary method to EUS-FNA.},

Benign hepatic lesions include hepatic cysts, hemagiomas, adenomas, and focal nodular hyperplasias. The utility of PET/CT in imaging primary hepatobiliary lesions varies according to the type and location of the lesion. CONCLUSION: There is a consistent benefit to the use of PET/CT for detection and staging, and it ultimately helps to establish the best course of treatment and to determine prognosis. In addition, PET/CT is very useful in local ablative and systemic therapy assessment and surveillance for hepatobiliary malignancies.},

abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is associated with a poor prognosis, and surgical resection remains the only chance for curative therapy. In the absence of metastatic disease, which would preclude resection, assessment of vascular invasion is an important parameter for determining resectability of pancreatic cancer. A frequent error is to misdiagnose an involved major vessel. Obviously, surgical exploration with pathological examination remains the "gold standard" in terms of evaluation of resectability, especially from the point of view of vascular involvement. However, current imaging modalities have improved and allow detection of vascular invasion with more accuracy. A venous resection in pancreatic cancer is a feasible technique and relatively reliable. Nevertheless, a survival benefit is not achieved by curative resection in patients with pancreatic cancer and vascular invasion. Although the discovery of an arterial invasion during the operation might require an aggressive management, discovery before the operation should be considered as a contraindication. Detection of vascular invasion remains one of the most important challenges in pancreatic surgery. The aim of this article is to provide a complete review of the different imaging modalities in the detection of vascular invasion in pancreatic cancer.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to assess the relative performance of mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced liver MRI and whole-body FDG PET for the detection of liver metastases from adenocarcinoma of the colon and pancreas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imaging data of 34 patients (23 men, 11 women; age range, 44-78 years) with adenocarcinoma of the colon (n = 27) or adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (n = 7) who had undergone mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced liver MRI and whole-body FDG PET were retrospectively reviewed for the presence and number of liver metastases. Histopathology (n = 25) or follow-up imaging (n = 9) served as the standard of reference. Breath-hold T1-weighted gradient-recalled echo, respiratory-triggered T2-weighted fast spin-echo, and mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced axial fat-saturated high-spatial-resolution (256 x 512) T1-weighted gradient-recalled echo images were obtained on a 1.5-T scanner. FDG PET was performed after the injection of 15-20 mCi (555-740 MBq) of FDG. The sensitivity, positive predictive value, and accuracy were calculated for each technique. The performances of the two techniques were compared using the Fisher's exact test.
RESULTS: Thirty patients had hepatic metastases and four had no hepatic metastases according to the standard of reference. The total number of metastases was 79, including 33 that measured less than 1 cm. Based on a per-patient analysis, MRI and FDG PET showed sensitivities of 96.6\% and 93.3\%, positive predictive values of 100\% and 90.3\%, and accuracies of 97.1\% and 85.3\%, respectively. According to a per-lesion analysis, MRI and FDG PET showed sensitivities of 81.4\% and 67.0\%, positive predictive values of 89.8\% and 81.3\%, and accuracies of 75.5\% and 64.1\%, respectively. MRI detected more hepatic metastases than FDG PET (p = 0.016). Of the 33 subcentimeter lesions confirmed on the standard of reference, all were identified on MRI, whereas only 12 were detected on FDG PET (p = 0.0001).
CONCLUSION: In patients with colon and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, high-spatial-resolution mangafodipir trisodium-enhanced liver MRI and whole-body FDG PET were comparable in the detection of patients with liver metastases. FDG PET provided additional information about extrahepatic disease and was useful in initial staging. However, significantly more and smaller liver metastases were detected on MRI than on FDG PET.},

From January 2002 through September 2009, the authors reviewed the clinical and imaging data of 130 consecutive patients (76 men, 54 women; mean age, 64.1 years; age range, 28–82 years) who had surgically proven 30-mm-diameter or smaller pancreatic cancers and underwent preoperative multidetector CT and 33 consecutive patients (17 men, 16 women; mean age, 65.1 years; age range, 48–84 years) who had histopathologically proven pancreatic cancer and underwent incidental multidetector CT before the diagnosis was rendered. Only pancreatic phase CT was performed in two patients, and only hepatic venous phase CT was performed in nine patients. Two radiologists in consensus classified the tumor attenuation as hyper-, iso-, or hypoattenuation during the pancreatic and hepatic venous phases. Accompanying secondary signs, temporal changes in tumor attenuation, and histopathologic findings also were analyzed. The Fisher exact test, $\chi$2 test, generalized estimating equation, and Student t test were used to compare the variables.Results: Seventy tumors were 20 mm or smaller, and 93 were 21–30 mm. Isoattenuating pancreatic cancers were more commonly observed among the 20-mm or smaller tumors (16 of 59, 27\%) than among the 21–30-mm tumors (12 of 93, 13\%) (P = .033). They were also more common among well-differentiated tumors (seven of 12, 58\%) than among moderately differentiated (20 of 124, 16\%) and poorly differentiated (one of 10, 10\%) tumors (P = .001). The prevalence of secondary signs differed significantly according to tumor size (53 [76\%] of 70 ≤20-mm tumors vs 92 [99\%] of 93 21–30-mm tumors) (P < .001). The prevalence of secondary signs was high among isoattenuating pancreatic cancers (14 [88\%] of 16 ≤20-mm tumors vs all 12 [100\%] 21–30-mm tumors). Most of the isoattenuating tumors seen at prediagnostic CT were hypoattenuating after 6 months (100\% [four of four] during pancreatic phase, 71\% [five of seven] during hepatic venous phase).Conclusion: The prevalence of isoattenuating pancreatic cancers differed significantly according to tumor size and cellular differentiation. Most small isoattenuating pancreatic cancers showed secondary signs.© RSNA, 2011Supplemental material: http://radiology.rsna.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1148/radiol.11101133/-/DC1},

Results: The frequency of bone metastasis from HCC was 19\% (49 of 257 patients; eight patients had histopathologic proof and 41 had imaging proof). Metastasis isolated to bone (group 1, 30 of 257 patients [12\%]) was more common than metastasis to bone and other sites (group 2, 19 of 257 patients [7\%]). At lesion-based analysis of group 1 (71 index lesions; mean lesion size ± standard deviation, 3.25 cm ± 1.88), 11C acetate PET was more sensitive than FDG PET (93\% [66 of 71 lesions] vs 62\% [44 of 71 lesions], respectively; P < .05). The combined sensitivity was 97\% (69 of 71 lesions) with dual-tracer PET and 72\% (51 of 71 lesions) with CT. At patient-based analysis, 11C acetate PET had an incremental value of 23\% (seven of 30 patients) over FDG PET. At lesion-based analysis of group 2, FDG PET was more sensitive than 11C acetate PET (87\% [33 of 38 lesions] vs 50\% [19 of 38 lesions], respectively; P < .05). Tracer avidities of metastatic bone lesions were closely correlated with that of their corresponding primary HCC tumors. The median survival time was longer in group 1 than in group 2 (18 months vs 11 months, respectively; P < .05).
Conclusion: Isolated bone metastasis from HCC may not be as uncommon as previously believed. The detection of these metastases can be significantly enhanced with 11C acetate PET compared with FDG PET alone. Identification of this group of patients also seems to have prognostic importance. © RSNA, 2010},

abstract = {BACKGROUND

Tumor markers in the early detection of tumors are promising tools that could improve the control and treatment of tumors. While alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) is a commonly used tumor marker in the detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), its sensitivity and specificity are insufficient to detect HCC in all patient samples.


METHODS

We compared AFP with serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGF and VEGF-A), insulin-like growth factor-2 (IGF-II), and the activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-L-fucosidase (AFU) in the sensitivity of detection of HCC and cirrhosis in Egyptian patients.


RESULTS

The sensitivity of tumor detection using AFP was 68.2\%. This level of detection was increased to 88.6\% when AFP was evaluated in conjunction with AFU. The combined use of AFP and VEGF increased the sensitivity of detection to 95.5\% in patients with HCC. The combination of the three markers yielded 100\% detection sensitivity. VEGF-A showed a low specificity (20\%), and IGF-II showed extremely low sensitivity (4.5\%).


CONCLUSIONS

We suggest that AFU or VEGF or both be measured with AFP to improve the detection sensitivity of HCC.},

abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer mortality in the United States, with 5-year survival rates for patients with resectable tumors ranging from 15\% to 20\%. However, most patients presenting with distant metastases, are not resectable, and have a 5-year survival rate of close to 0\%. This demonstrates a need for improved screening to identify pancreatic cancer while the tumor is still localized and amenable to surgical resection. Studies of patients with pancreatic tumors incidentally diagnosed demonstrate longer median survival than tumors discovered only when the patient is symptomatic, suggesting that early detection may improve outcome. Recent evidence from genomic sequencing indicates a 15-year interval for genetic progression of pancreatic cancer from initiation to the metastatic stage, suggesting a sufficient window for early detection. Still, many challenges remain in implementing effective screening. Early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer relies on developing screening methodologies with highly sensitive and specific biomarkers and imaging modalities. It also depends on a better understanding of the risk factors and natural history of the disease to accurately identify high-risk groups that would be best served by screening. This review summarizes our current understanding of the biology of pancreatic cancer relevant to methods available for screening. At this time, given the lack of proven benefit in this disease, screening efforts should probably be undertaken in the context of prospective trials.},

abstract = {Fused positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is a recently developed technology that couples the functional information of PET with the anatomic details of CT. Integrated PET/CT scanners produce both PET and contrast material-enhanced CT images of the entire body in one setting. Typically, the amount of fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in normal pancreatic parenchyma is insignificant compared with that of the liver. However, both malignant (eg, adenocarcinoma) and benign (eg, acute pancreatitis) pancreatic conditions may demonstrate intense FDG uptake. PET/CT provides an opportunity to depict pancreatic tumors and distant metastases, perform preoperative staging, and monitor response to treatment, and it has proved useful in distinguishing postoperative fibrosis from recurrence. In selected cases, PET/CT findings may be used to help diagnose autoimmune pancreatitis mimicking a mass by depicting systemic involvement. PET/CT may also be used to direct biopsy to sites more likely to yield representative tumor tissue. Novel radiolabeled molecules, such as sigma-receptor ligands and 18F-3'-fluoro-3'-deoxy-l-thymidine (FLT), may play an even greater role in distinguishing tumor recurrence from postoperative fibrosis or inflammation.},

abstract = {Purpose:To compare the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of pancreatic adenocarcinomas that appear hyperintense with clearly defined borders (clear hyperintense) with those that do not show clear hyperintense borders on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images.Materials and Methods:Institutional review board approval was obtained and informed consent was waived. Eighty patients with histologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mean tumor size, 32 mm) underwent fat-suppressed single-shot echo-planar 3.0-T diffusion-weighted MR imaging with diffusion gradients (b = 1000 sec/mm(2)). ADC values of the pancreatic adenocarcinomas (n = 80) and proximal (n = 51) and distal (n = 70) pancreas were compared by using the Friedman test, followed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the difference in serum amylase levels between pancreatic adenocarcinomas with and without clear hyperintensity was evaluated by using the x(2) test.Results:In 38 of 80 patients, pancreatic adenocarcinomas showed clear hyperintensity relative to the surrounding pancreas; 26 were hyperintense with unclear distal borders; 12, isointense; and four, hypointense. In all patients, the mean ADC (± standard deviation) of the tumors (1.16 × 10(-3) mm(2)/sec ± 0.22) was significantly lower than those of the proximal pancreas (1.33 × 10(-3) mm(2)/sec ± 0.16, P < .001) and the distal pancreatic parenchyma (1.24 × 10(-3) mm(2)/sec ± 0.23, P = .004). No significant difference in ADC was seen between the pancreatic adenocarcinomas without clear hyperintensity and the distal pancreas. The frequency of serum amylase levels greater than 120 U/L (2.00 $\mu$kat/L) was significantly higher than in those with clear hyperintense pancreatic adenocarcinomas (P < .001).Conclusion:Diffusion-weighted MR imaging was not useful for delineating 47\% of pancreatic adenocarcinomas, because of hyperintensity of the pancreatic parenchyma distal to the cancer.© RSNA, 2012.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Differentiation between metastasis-free pancreatic cancer and mass-forming pancreatitis is important to avoid unnecessary operative procedures. This study was aimed at evaluating the efficacy of PET/CT with F-FDG (FDG PET/CT) for the differential diagnosis between them. PATIENTS AND METHODS: FDG-PET/CT was performed in 47 study patients with pancreatic masses and without any detectable metastases, 33 of which cases were finally diagnosed as pancreatic cancer and the other 14 as pancreatitis, and the corresponding imaging data were evaluated retrospectively. The maximal SUV (SUVmax) within the masses were determined at 1 hour and mostly at 2 hours after intravenous injection of FDG. RESULTS: SUVmax at 1 hour in pancreatic cancer was significantly higher than that in mass-forming pancreatitis, and the change in SUVmax from 1- to 2-hour time points was more consistent with pancreatic cancer than with mass-forming pancreatitis. However, there remained considerable overlapping between the SUVmax values of both diseases except either at the higher range for pancreatic cancer (>7.7 at 1 hour or >9.98 at 2 hours) or at the lower range for mass-forming pancreatitis (<3.37 at 1 hour or <3.53 at 2 hours). No obvious difference was found in the FDG uptake patterns of the mass areas between both diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Differentiation between metastasis-free pancreatic cancer and mass-forming pancreatitis is difficult by FDG-PET/CT due to considerable overlapping between the SUVmax values of the two diseases, although the differential diagnosis may be possible either at the higher range of SUVmax (> 7.7 at 1 hour or >9.98 at 2 hours) for pancreatic cancer or at the lower range of SUVmax (<3.37 at 1 hour or <3.53 at 2 hours) for mass-forming pancreatitis.},

abstract = {Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a common gastrointestinal malignancy that has a poor prognosis and for which successful surgical resection is the only method of cure. Preoperative staging and assessment can be performed with a number of modalities. Multidetector (64-section) volumetric computed tomography (CT) allows rapid anatomic coverage coupled with excellent spatial resolution. Understanding the technical parameters necessary for successful pancreatic CT angiography is crucial. Carefully timed scan acquisition maximizes the difference in attenuation between the neoplasm and the pancreatic parenchyma and allows accurate local and distant staging as well as assessment of local resectability. In addition, angiographic data sets can be rendered to create displays of the local venous and arterial anatomy that are familiar to surgeons. Advanced rendering can also be used to create pancreaticographic type images. The TNM system of staging for pancreatic adenocarcinoma is not frequently included in radiology reporting but is important for deciding on optimal therapy and neoadjuvant therapy.© RSNA, 2007},

abstract = {In Asia, the incidence of pancreatic cancer in some countries has been increasing. Owing to most cases being diagnosed late, prognosis for pancreatic cancer remains dismal. It is clear that the future for pancreatic cancer lies in early detection. While the possible presence of pancreatic masses is often first raised by non-invasive abdominal imaging, such as computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, smaller lesions and locoregional lymph node metastases are often not detectable by these means. Endoscopic ultrasonography (\{EUS)\} offers a higher sensitivity (93-100\%) for detection of small potentially curable pancreatic masses than other existing imaging modalities. It is also recommended for the evaluation of portal vein confluence, portal vein, celiac axis, and superior mesentric artery origin, and exclusion of resectability. Due to the closer proximity of \{EUS\} to the target structure, and lower rate of needle tract seeding, \{EUS-guided\} fine-needle aspiration of pancreatic mass is considered the most suitable tissue acquisition technique. Lastly, \{EUS\} also enables the performance of endoscopic interventions. Its performance can be further enhanced with newer techniques, including contrast-enhanced ultrasound and elastrography. It is anticipated that in the near future, molecular technologies may make it possible to detect microscopic amounts of cancer in tissue or blood, predict relapse and survival after therapy, as well as determine optimal therapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: The risk of pancreatic cancer is increased in patients with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer or a predisposing germline mutation. Screening can detect curable, noninvasive pancreatic neoplasms, but the optimal imaging approach is not known. We determined the baseline prevalence and characteristics of pancreatic abnormalities using 3 imaging tests to screen asymptomatic, high-risk individuals (HRIs). METHODS: We screened 225 asymptomatic adult HRIs at 5 academic US medical centers once, using computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). We compared results in a blinded, independent fashion. RESULTS: Ninety-two of 216 HRIs (42\%) were found to have at least 1 pancreatic mass (84 cystic, 3 solid) or a dilated pancreatic duct (n = 5) by any of the imaging modalities. Fifty-one of the 84 HRIs with a cyst (60.7\%) had multiple lesions, typically small (mean, 0.55 cm; range, 2-39 mm), in multiple locations. The prevalence of pancreatic lesions increased with age; they were detected in 14\% of subjects younger than 50 years old, 34\% of subjects 50-59 years old, and 53\% of subjects 60-69 years old (P < .0001). CT, MRI, and EUS detected a pancreatic abnormality in 11\%, 33.3\%, and 42.6\% of the HRIs, respectively. Among these abnormalities, proven or suspected neoplasms were identified in 85 HRIs (82 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and 3 pancreatic endocrine tumors). Three of 5 HRIs who underwent pancreatic resection had high-grade dysplasia in less than 3 cm intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms and in multiple intraepithelial neoplasias. CONCLUSIONS: Screening of asymptomatic HRIs frequently detects small pancreatic cysts, including curable, noninvasive high-grade neoplasms. EUS and MRI detect pancreatic lesions better than CT.},

These asymptomatic \{FPCs\} detected have been more likely to be resectable, compared to symptomatic tumors. The most challenging part of screening high-risk individuals is the selection of individuals with high-grade precursor neoplasms for preventive treatment (ie, surgical resection before development of invasive cancer). Ongoing and future research should focus on formulating and validating a model for \{FPC\} risk and neoplastic progression using patient characteristics, imaging, and biomarkers. The comparative cost and effectiveness of various approaches for screening and surveillance of high-risk individuals also deserves study.

F-18 FDG PET can increase the accuracy of staging primary tumors of the liver or the pancreas, and can be used for response monitoring. Radiopharmaceuticals such as Ga-68 DOTATOC and F-18 DOPA allow the specific detection of neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors and their metastatic deposits. Hybrid scanners such as PET-CT integrate morphologic and metabolic information, and allow to increase the sensitivity and specificity of noninvasive imaging in many tumor entities. The development of specific radiopharmaceuticals and technical innovations such as SPECT-CT has increased the reliability of conventional scintigraphic imaging.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the regional pancreatectomy as surgical therapy for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and to evaluate potential prognostic factors. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Regional pancreatectomy was developed as a more adequate surgical procedure for pancreatic cancer in an attempt to improve the cure rate for this highly lethal disease. Few studies have evaluated large numbers of patients treated with this technique, and in recent years the emphasis has been on more limited surgery for pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Fifty-six patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head were treated by regional subtotal or total pancreatectomy. Clinical and pathologic parameters were reviewed and potential prognostic factors were compared statistically. The three patients who died within 30 days of the operation were excluded from the survival analysis. RESULTS: Primary tumor size was the strongest determinant of prognosis. The mean tumor size was 3.9 cm (range, 1-7 cm). Eighty-five percent of patients had peripancreatic soft tissue invasion microscopically, and 58\% had regional lymph node metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated a 33\% 5-year survival for patients with tumor 2.5 cm or less in diameter (n=12) and 12\% for patients with larger tumors (n=39). No patient with a tumor larger than 5 cm survived more than 5 years. Mean tumor size was not significantly associated with lymph node metastases, but 5 of 12 patients (42\%) with primary tumor < or =2.5 cm had lymph node metastases. Twenty-four percent of patients with negative lymph nodes and 14\% with positive lymph nodes survived 5 years. The difference was not statistically significant (p=0.3), but this is likely related to sample size. The 30- day operative mortality was 5.3\%. The most common complications were infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and gastric stasis. CONCLUSIONS: After regional pancreatectomy, tumor size is the strongest predictor of prognosis. A multi- institutional randomized prospective trial of regional pancreatectomy versus pancreaticoduodenectomy is warranted in previously untreated, noninfected cases.},

abstract = {Pancreatic cancer (\{PC)\} is the fourth most common cause of cancer deaths in Western societies. It is an aggressive tumor with an overall 5-year survival rate of less than 5\%. Surgical resection offers the only possibility of cure and long-term survival for patients suffering from \{PC;\} however, unfortunately, fewer than 20\% of patients suffering from \{PC\} have disease that is amendable to surgical resection. Therefore, it is important to accurately diagnose and stage these patients to enable optimal treatment of their disease. The imaging modalities involved in the diagnosis and staging of \{PC\} include multidetector \{CT\} scanning, endoscopic ultrasound (\{EUS)\}, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography and \{MRI.\} The roles and relative importance of these imaging modalities have changed over the last few decades and continue to change owing to the rapid technological advances in medical imaging, but these investigations continue to be complementary. \{EUS\} was first introduced in the mid-1980s in Japan and Germany and has quickly gained acceptance. Its widespread use in the last decade has revolutionized the management of pancreatic disease as it simultaneously provides primary diagnostic and staging information, as well as enabling tissue biopsy. This article discusses the potential benefits and drawbacks of \{EUS\} in the primary diagnosis, staging and assessment of resectability, and \{EUS-guided\} fine-needle aspiration in \{PC.\} Difficult diagnostic scenarios and pitfalls are also discussed. A suggested management algorithm for patients with suspected \{PC\} is also presented.},

abstract = {\{BACKGROUND:\} Screening individuals at increased risk for pancreatic cancer (\{PC)\} detects early, potentially curable, pancreatic neoplasia. \{OBJECTIVE:\} To develop consortium statements on screening, surveillance and management of high-risk individuals with an inherited predisposition to \{PC.\} \{METHODS:\} A 49-expert multidisciplinary international consortium met to discuss pancreatic screening and vote on statements. Consensus was considered reached if \{$\backslash$textgreater\}/= 75\% agreed or disagreed. \{RESULTS:\} There was excellent agreement that, to be successful, a screening programme should detect and treat \{T1N0M0\} margin-negative \{PC\} and high-grade dysplastic precursor lesions (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm). It was agreed that the following were candidates for screening: first-degree relatives (\{FDRs)\} of patients with \{PC\} from a familial \{PC\} kindred with at least two affected \{FDRs;\} patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome; and p16, \{BRCA2\} and hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (\{HNPCC)\} mutation carriers with \{$\backslash$textgreater\}/= 1 affected \{FDR.\} Consensus was not reached for the age to initiate screening or stop surveillance. It was agreed that initial screening should include endoscopic ultrasonography (\{EUS)\} and/or \{MRI/magnetic\} resonance cholangiopancreatography not \{CT\} or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. There was no consensus on the need for \{EUS\} fine-needle aspiration to evaluate cysts. There was disagreement on optimal screening modalities and intervals for follow-up imaging. When surgery is recommended it should be performed at a high-volume centre. There was great disagreement as to which screening abnormalities were of sufficient concern to for surgery to be recommended. \{CONCLUSIONS:\} Screening is recommended for high-risk individuals, but more evidence is needed, particularly for how to manage patients with detected lesions. Screening and subsequent management should take place at high-volume centres with multidisciplinary teams, preferably within research protocols.},

abstract = {The ability to diagnose pancreatic carcinoma has been rapidly improving with the recent advances in diagnostic techniques such as contrast-enhanced Doppler ultrasound (US), helical computed tomography (CT), enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and endoscopic US (EUS). Each technique has advantages and limitations, making the selection of the proper diagnostic technique, in terms of purpose and characteristics, especially important. Abdominal US is the modality often used first to identify a cause of abdominal pain or jaundice, while the accuracy of conventional US for diagnosing pancreatic tumors is only 50–70\%. CT is the most widely used imaging examination for the detection and staging of pancreatic carcinoma. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is generally depicted as a hypoattenuating area on contrast-enhanced CT. The reported sensitivity of helical CT in revealing pancreatic carcinoma is high, ranging between 89\% and 97\%. Multi-detector-row (MD) CT may offer an improvement in the early detection and accurate staging of pancreatic carcinoma. It should be taken into consideration that some pancreatic adenocarcinomas are depicted as isoattenuating and that pancreatitis accompanied by pancreatic adenocarcinoma might occasionally result in the overestimation of staging. T1-weighted spin-echo images with fat suppression and dynamic gradient-echo MR images enhanced with gadolinium have been reported to be superior to helical CT for detecting small lesions. However, chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma are not distinguished on the basis of degree and time of enhancement on dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MRI. EUS is superior to spiral CT and MRI in the detection of small tumors, and can also localize lymph node metastases or vascular tumor infiltration with high sensitivity. EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a safe and highly accurate method for tissue diagnosis of patients with suspected pancreatic carcinoma. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) has been suggested as a promising modality for noninvasive differentiation between benign and malignant lesions. Previous studies reported the sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET for detecting malignant pancreatic tumors as being 71–100\% and 64–90\%, respectively. FDG-PET does not replace, but is complementary to morphologic imaging, and therefore, in doubtful cases, the method must be combined with other imaging modalities.},

abstract = {The fate of a patient with acute pancreatitis largely depends on early recognition of the severity of the disease. Acute pancreatitis is severe when organ failure and/or pancreatic necrosis occur. Whereas simple and low cost parameters are available for the detection of organ failure, the detection and extent of pancreatic necrosis requires a costly contrast-enhanced computed tomography. This is not always available in all institutions. This review article which considers when the clinician should be concerned about his patient diagnosed with acute pancreatitis, summarizes possibilities for diagnosing clinical severe (that is organ failure) and radiological severe (that is the necrotizing form of the disease) pancreatitis using simple and inexpensive parameters which are available everywhere. At present, a CT scan should be performed in those patients with alcohol etiology, those admitted to hospital early (time interval between the onset of symptoms and admission to hospital of less than 24 h, those presenting with rebound tenderness and/or guarding, a lipase >1,000 U/l, as well as a raised hematocrit and blood glucose. The evaluation, furthermore, shows that some parameters have a sufficiently high negative predictive value of >90\%, which may render a contrast-enhanced CT scan unnecessary in the early stages, unless the patient fails to improve. These parameters include non-alcohol etiology, time interval between onset and admission to hospital longer than 24 h, no guarding or rebound tenderness on admission, low or normal hematocrit and nonelevated blood glucose. It is necessary to look further on simple low cost and more valid parameters on admission in order to reliably distinguish between necrotizing pancreatitis and interstitial pancreatitis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND

It is well known that pancreatic cancer is rarely cured and is usually fatal. The clinicopathological features of small (greatest dimension < or = 2 cm by histologic measurement) carcinoma of the pancreas (s-PC), were reviewed, paying special attention to new computed tomography (CT) finding that suggests the presence of s-PC.


METHODOLOGY

Sixteen patients with s-PC have undergone curative surgery at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital during the past 11 years. Their preoperative diagnostic findings, pathological findings and postoperative prognoses were analyzed.


RESULTS

The most useful diagnostic clue was dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (MPD). It was difficult to identify the tumor in four patients because of pancreatitis accompanying the MPD obstruction. In three of these four cases, early phase-enhanced CT revealed a contrasting effect between the proximal and distal sides of the pancreatic parenchyma at the site of the MPD obstruction (black \& white sign). The longest diameters of the tumors ranged from 0.9 to 2 cm (average 1.3 cm). Positive rates of capsular invasion, retroperitoneal invasion, and lymph node metastasis were 6.3\% (1/16), 31.3\% (5/16), and 18.8\% (3/16), respectively. Six patients (37.5\%) were classed at stage I, six (37.5\%) stage II, three (18.8\%) stage III, and one (6.2\%) at stage IV according to pathological TNM classification. One patient died of the disease, and the cumulative 3- and 5-year survival rates were 88.9\% and 59.3\%, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS

The presence of s-PC qualifies as early PC and has a good prognosis. The CT black + white sign will be useful in the diagnosis of s-PC accompanying pancreatitis.},

Early diagnosis remains the only possibility nowadays for an intention to cure the disease, since prognosis of \{PC\} is significantly better in patients diagnosed of small (\{$\backslash$textless\}2 cm), well differentiated, stages I and \{II\} pancreatic tumors. However, the best approach would be to detect precursor lesions, like Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (\{IPMN)\} or \{PanIN\} lesions.

abstract = {The detection of pancreatic cancer or the discrimination between pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis remains an important diagnostic problem. Several imaging modalities are now used to diagnose pancreatic cancer, including transabdominal ultrasonography (US), contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), endoscopic ultrasonography, and selective angiography. None of these six methods is perfect: Each has advantages and disadvantages, and their sensitivity and specificity are in a high range. In 1990 positron emission tomography (PET) was first applied to diagnose pancreatic cancer. This new diagnostic modality is based on functional changes in the pancreatic cancer cells caused by enhanced glucose metabolism. Increased glucose utilization is one of the characteristics of malignantly transformed cells, independent of their origin. The technical development of PET has allowed this new procedure to be used for clinical evaluation. Using 2-((18)F)-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose, PET can identify pancreatic cancer and differentiate pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis with a sensitivity of 85\% to 98\% and a specificity of 53\% to 93\%. However, high sensitivity and high specificity are strongly dependent on the tumor stage. At present PET is still experimental and is available only in specialized centers. It may represent a new and noninvasive diagnostic procedure for the detection and the staging of pancreatic cancer.

abstract = {BACKGROUND

Several factors contribute to the high mortality of pancreatic cancer, including limitations of diagnostic imaging.


AIM

To perform a meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of Fluro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography compared with computed tomography alone.


METHODS

Articles were identified through a MEDLINE search and bibliography review. Summary estimates and receiver operating curves were calculated using Meta-Test 0.6. Publication bias and heterogeneity were assessed with a funnel plot and chi-squared test.


RESULTS

The summary estimate and 95\% confidence interval for sensitivity and specificity were as follows: computed tomography 81\% (72-88\%) and 66\% (53-77\%), PET after a positive computed tomography 92\% (87-95\%) and 68\% (51-81\%), PET after a negative computed tomography 73\% (50-88\%) and 86\% (75-93\%) and PET after an indeterminate computed tomography 100 and 68\%. The area under the summary receiver operating curve was 0.82 for computed tomography and 0.94 for PET. There was no heterogeneity or publication bias.


CONCLUSIONS

Our results suggest that although adding Fluro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography to the diagnostic work-up may enhance the diagnosis of pancreatic malignancy, its usefulness will vary depending upon the pretest probability of the patient, the results of computed tomography and the provider's testing thresholds. Further evaluation using a well-designed prospective study with a cost-effectiveness analysis is needed to clarify the appropriate role of Fluro-deoxy-glucose positron emission tomography.},

FDG-PET has been established as a tool for the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma (CA). Early detection is mandatory as cure can only be achieved in non-advanced disease. This is, however, very difficult with conventional radiological techniques. Patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) are at risk of developing CA. A simple, reliable screening method for malignant degeneration is highly desirable. We set out to investigate whether FDG-PET is able to detect CA in the setting of CP and can fulfil a potential role in the early detection of CA in CP.},

abstract = {The detection of pancreatic cancer or the discrimination between pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis remains an important diagnostic problem. The increased glucose metabolism in malignant tumours formed the basis for this investigation, which focused on the role of positron emission tomography (PET) with 2[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) in the detection of pancreatic cancer and its differentiation from chronic pancreatitis. Eighty patients admitted for elective pancreatic surgery received preoperatively 250-350 mBq FDG intravenously and emission scans were recorded 45 minutes later. Intense focal activity in the pancreatic region was taken at the time of scanning as showing the presence of pancreatic cancer. The presence of cancer was later confirmed by histological examination of the surgical specimens and histological findings were compared with the preoperative PET results. Forty one patients with pancreatic cancer (group I: n = 42) had a focally increased FDG uptake in the pancreatic region. Two patients with a periampullary carcinoma (group II: n = 6) failed to develop FDG accumulation. In 28 patients with chronic pancreatitis (group III: n = 32) no FDG accumulation occurred. Overall sensitivity and specificity of PET for malignancy (group I + II) were 94\% (45 of 48) and 88\% (28 of 32), respectively. The standard uptake value of the patients with pancreatic carcinoma was significantly higher than in patients with chronic pancreatitis (3.09 (2.18) v 0.87 (0.56); p < 0.001; median (interquartile range)). These findings show that FDG-PET represents a new and non-invasive diagnostic procedure for the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and to differentiate pancreatic cancer from chronic pancreatitis. However, the diagnostic potential of this technique requires further evaluation.},

abstract = {A wide spectrum of anomalies of the pancreas, the pancreatic ductal system, and the biliary tree are commonly encountered at radiologic evaluation. These anomalies may simulate various neoplastic, inflammatory, and posttraumatic conditions and should be part of the differential diagnosis for a variety of abnormalities found at diagnostic imaging. Anatomic variants, developmental anomalies (eg, pancreas divisum, annular pancreas, ectopic pancreas, pancreatic agenesis and hypoplasia), and congenital diseases (congenital pancreatic cysts, von Hippel–Lindau disease, choledochal cysts), in addition to potential imaging pitfalls (uneven distribution of fat, “pseudomasses”), can all pose a diagnostic challenge for the radiologist. Familiarity with these anomalies, the imaging techniques available for their study, and their variable imaging manifestations is necessary for differentiating them from other biliary and pancreatic conditions. A basic understanding of the embryologic development and normal anatomy of the pancreas and biliary tree is also essential for identifying these anomalies.© RSNA, 2006},

The objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of pancreatic perfusion computed tomography (CT) and review pancreatic perfusion measurements by various imaging modalities.


METHODS

Dynamic CT data from 8 patients (4 men; mean age, 64.8 [SD, 12.1] years; range, 40-80 years) with normal pancreas were analyzed using 2 analytical models: the maximum-slope and compartment-model methods. Literature search was also performed.


RESULTS

Although the perfusion value estimated by the maximum-slope method (88.1 [SD, 42.1] mL/min per 100 mL) was significantly smaller than that of the compartment-model method (127.0 [SD, 70.5]; P < 0.001), there was a linear correlation between them (r = 0.97, P < 0.001). In the literature review, 15 studies that reported the absolute values of normal pancreatic perfusion, by using perfusion CT, dynamic magnetic resonance imaging, hydrogen gas clearance method, and 15O-H2O-positron emission tomography were found. The reported mean values of normal pancreatic perfusion ranged from 38.4 to 356 mL/min per 100 mL, and there was a great deal of individual variation.


CONCLUSIONS

Perfusion CT may provide reliable perfusion measurements of the pancreas, and the normal value was estimated at around 100 mL/min per 100 mL with a great deal of individual variation. The maximum-slope method may provide a lower perfusion value compared with the compartment-model method.},

abstract = {Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an aggressive malignancy with the majority of patients dying within one year of diagnosis. While surgical resection with negative margins offers the only hope for cure only a small minority of patients are amenable to resection at the time of diagnosis owing to the propensity for early metastasis. While most advances in the last several decades have revolved around improvements in surgical techniques and postoperative outcomes, some modest inroads have been made with modern chemotherapy. This review discusses the diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer and highlights some of the current issues. A Medline database search was performed to identify relevant articles using the keywords "pancreatic adenocarcinoma", "diagnosis", \{"CA19-9"\}, "pancreaticoduodenectomy", "adjuvant therapy", "chemotherapy", and \{"microRNA".\} Additional papers were then identified by a manual search of the references from the key articles. While high quality \{CT\} is often the only imaging modality needed for preoperative evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (\{MRI)\}, cholangiography, and endoscopic ultrasound (\{EUS)\} have been utilized for diagnosis, staging, and/ or palliation. The controversies of pylorus preservation, extended lymphadenectomy, and laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy are discussed. Randomized controlled trials regarding the use of 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine are also reviewed. Early detection and aggressive surgical resection in combination with protocol-driven adjuvant therapy and novel molecular approaches are the only hope for cure. This review summarizes the recent literature on the abovementioned topics.},

They are being discovered with increasing frequency as the use of high quality cross sectional imaging is becoming more widespread. These lesions cover a wide spectrum of pathology from benign simple cysts through potentially malignant lesions such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia, to frankly malignant adenocarcinoma. In this article we outline the incidence, imaging characteristics and natural history of the various incidental lesions with emphasis to neuroendocrine tumors. A diagnostic approach is also suggested, including the rational use of further imaging, serum biochemistry and the utility of ultrasound guided aspiration of cyst fluid if present.

abstract = {The aim of this study was to evaluate fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG PET) as a tool for the differential diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma while taking into account serum glucose level. A group of 106 patients with unclear pancreatic masses were recruited for the study. PET was performed following intravenous administration of an average of 190 MBq [18F]FDG. Focally increased glucose utilisation was used as the criterion of malignancy. In addition, the "standardised uptake value" (SUV) was determined 45 min after injection. Carcinoma of the pancreas was demonstrated histologically in 74 cases, and chronic pancreatitis in 32 cases. Employing visual evaluation, 63 of the 74 (85\%) pancreatic carcinomas were identified by PET. In 27 of the 32 cases (84\%) of chronic pancreatitis it was possible to exclude malignancy. False-negative results (n=11) were obtained mostly in patients with raised serum glucose levels (10 out of 11), and false-positives (n=5) in patients with inflammatory processes of the pancreas. Thus PET showed an overall sensitivity of 85\%, a specificity of 84\%, a negative predictive value of 71\%, and a positive predictive value of 93\%. In a subgroup of patients with normal serum glucose levels (n=72), the results were 98\%, 84\%, 96\% and 93\%, respectively. Quantitative assessment yielded a mean SUV of 6.4+/-3.6 for pancreatic carcinoma as against a value of 3.6+/-1.7 for chronic pancreatitis (P<0.001), without increasing the diagnostic accuracy. This shows PET to be of value in assessing unclear pancreatic masses. The diagnostic accuracy of PET examinations is very dependent on serum glucose levels.},
